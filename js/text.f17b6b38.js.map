not differ materially from the fourth. I have\\\\r\\\\nincorporated some new material, including Colomb and Bolton's flashing\\\\r\\\\nsignals, but in other respects the Work is little altered. I therefore\\\\r\\\\nreprint the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn publishing a fourth Edition of the 'Art of Travel,' it is well that I\\\\r\\\\nshould preface it with a few words of explanation on the origin and\\\\r\\\\nintention of the Book and on the difference between this and former\\\\r\\\\nEditions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe idea of the work occurred to me when exploring South-western Africa\\\\r\\\\nin 1850-51. I felt acutely at that time the impossibility of obtaining\\\\r\\\\nsufficient information on the subjects of which it treats; for though the\\\\r\\\\nnatives of that country taught me a great deal, it was obvious that their\\\\r\\\\nacquaintance with bush lore was exceedingly partial and limited. Then\\\\r\\\\nremembering how the traditional maxims and methods of travelling in each\\\\r\\\\ncountry differ from those of others, and how every traveller discovers\\\\r\\\\nsome useful contrivances for himself, it appeared to me, that I should do\\\\r\\\\nwelcome service to all who have to rough it--whether explorers,\\\\r\\\\nemigrants, missionaries or soldiers,*--by collecting the scattered\\\\r\\\\nexperiences of many such persons in various circumstances, collating\\\\r\\\\nthem, examining into their principles, and deducing from them what might\\\\r\\\\nfairly be called an \\\\\\\"Art of Travel.\\\\\\\" To this end, on my return home, I\\\\r\\\\nsearched through a vast number of geographical works, I sought\\\\r\\\\ninformation from numerous travellers of distinction and I made a point of\\\\r\\\\nre-testing, in every needful case, what I had read or learned by hearsay.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Footnote] * \\\\\\\". . . the soldier should be taught all such practical\\\\r\\\\nexpedients and their philosophy, as are laid down in Mr. Galton's useful\\\\r\\\\nlittle book . . . \\\\\\\"--'Minute by the late Sir James Outram on Army\\\\r\\\\nManagement.' Parliamentary Return, of May 240, p. 159.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt should be understood that I do not profess to give exhaustive\\\\r\\\\ntreatises on each of the numerous subjects comprised in this volume, but\\\\r\\\\nonly such information as is not generally known among travellers. A\\\\r\\\\nstriking instance of the limited geographical area over which the\\\\r\\\\nknowledge of many useful contrivances extends, is that described as a\\\\r\\\\n'Dateram,' p. 164, by which tent ropes may be secured in sand of the\\\\r\\\\nloosest description. Though tents are used over an enormous extent of\\\\r\\\\nsandy country, in all of which this simple contrivance would be of the\\\\r\\\\nutmost value on every stormy night, and though the art of pitching tents\\\\r\\\\nis studied by the troops of all civilised and partly civilised nations,\\\\r\\\\nyet I believe that the use of the dateram never extended beyond the\\\\r\\\\nlimits of a comparatively small district in the south of the Sahara,\\\\r\\\\nuntil I had described it in a former Edition; and further, my knowledge\\\\r\\\\nof that contrivance was wholly due to a single traveller, the late Dr.\\\\r\\\\nBarth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe first Edition of the 'Art of Travel' was published in 1854: it was\\\\r\\\\nfar less comprehensive than the later ones; for my materials steadily\\\\r\\\\naccumulate, and each successive Edition has shown a marked improvement on\\\\r\\\\nits predecessor. Hitherto I have adhered to the original arrangement of\\\\r\\\\nthe work, but am now obliged to deviate from it, for the contents have\\\\r\\\\noutgrown the system of classification I first adopted. Before I could\\\\r\\\\ninterpolate the new matter prepared for this Edition, I found it\\\\r\\\\nnecessary to recast the last one, by cutting it into pieces, sorting it\\\\r\\\\ninto fresh paragraphs and thoroughly revising the writing--disentangling\\\\r\\\\nhere and consolidating there. The present Edition will consequently be\\\\r\\\\nfound more conveniently arranged than those that preceded it, and, at the\\\\r\\\\nsame time, I trust the copiousness of its Index will enable persons to\\\\r\\\\nfind with readiness any passage they had remarked in a former Edition,\\\\r\\\\nand to which they may desire again to refer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI am still most thankful to strangers as well as to friends for\\\\r\\\\ncontributions of hints or corrections, having been indebted to many a\\\\r\\\\npreviously unknown correspondent for valuable information. I beg that\\\\r\\\\nsuch communications may be addressed to me, care of my publisher, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nMurray, 50, Albermarle Street, London.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* * * * *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nP.S.--A reviewer of my Third Edition accused me of copying largely from\\\\r\\\\nan American book, called 'The Prairie Traveller,' by, the then, Capt.\\\\r\\\\nRandolph B. Marcy. I therefore think it well to remark that the first\\\\r\\\\nEdition of that work was published in 1859 (Harper and Brothers, New\\\\r\\\\nYork;--by authority of the American War Department), and that the\\\\r\\\\npassages in question are all taken from my second Edition published in\\\\r\\\\n1856; part of them are copies of what I had myself written, the rest are\\\\r\\\\nreprints of my quotations, as though the Author of the 'Prairie\\\\r\\\\nTraveller' had himself originally selected them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI take this opportunity of remarking that though I have been indebted for\\\\r\\\\ninformation to a very large number of authors and correspondents, yet I\\\\r\\\\nam sorry to be unable to make my acknowledgements except in comparatively\\\\r\\\\nfew instances. The fact is that the passages in this book are seldom\\\\r\\\\ntraceable to distinctly definite sources: commonly more than one person\\\\r\\\\ngiving me information that partially covers the same subject, and not\\\\r\\\\nunfrequently my own subsequent enquiries modifying or enlarging the hints\\\\r\\\\nI had received. Consequently I have given the names of authorities only\\\\r\\\\nwhen my information has been wholly due to them, or when their\\\\r\\\\ndescriptions are so graphic that I have transferred them without\\\\r\\\\nalteration into my pages, or else when their statements require\\\\r\\\\nconfirmation. It will be easy to see by the context to which of these\\\\r\\\\ncategories each quotation belongs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrancis Galton\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nART OF TRAVEL.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPREPARATORY INQUIRIES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo those who meditate Travel.--Qualifications for a Traveller.--If you\\\\r\\\\nhave health, a great craving for adventure, at least a moderate fortune,\\\\r\\\\nand can set your heart on a definite object, which old travellers do not\\\\r\\\\nthink impracticable, then--travel by all means. If, in addition to these\\\\r\\\\nqualifications, you have scientific taste and knowledge, I believe that\\\\r\\\\nno career, in time of peace, can offer to you more advantages than that\\\\r\\\\nof a traveller. If you have not independent means, you may still turn\\\\r\\\\ntravelling to excellent account; for experience shows it often leads to\\\\r\\\\npromotion, nay, some men support themselves by travel. They explore\\\\r\\\\npasture land in Australia, they hunt for ivory in Africa, they collect\\\\r\\\\nspecimens of natural history for sale, or they wander as artists.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReputed Dangers of Travel.--A young man of good constitution, who is\\\\r\\\\nbound on an enterprise sanctioned by experienced travellers, does not run\\\\r\\\\nvery great risks. Let those who doubt, refer to the history of the\\\\r\\\\nvarious expeditions encouraged by the Royal Geographical Society, and\\\\r\\\\nthey will see how few deaths have occurred; and of those deaths how small\\\\r\\\\na proportion among young travellers. Savages rarely murder new-comers;\\\\r\\\\nthey fear their guns, and have a superstitious awe of the white man's\\\\r\\\\npower: they require time to discover that he is not very different to\\\\r\\\\nthemselves, and easily to be made away with. Ordinary fever are seldom\\\\r\\\\nfatal to the sound and elastic constitution of youth, which usually has\\\\r\\\\npower to resist the adverse influences of two or three years of wild\\\\r\\\\nlife.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdvantages of Travel.--It is no slight advantage to a young man, to have\\\\r\\\\nthe opportunity for distinction which travel affords. If he plans his\\\\r\\\\njourney among scenes and places likely to interest the stay-at-home\\\\r\\\\npublic, he will probably achieve a reputation that might well be envied\\\\r\\\\nby wiser men who have not had his opportunities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe scientific advantages of travel are enormous to a man prepared to\\\\r\\\\nprofit by them. He sees Nature working by herself, without the\\\\r\\\\ninterference of human intelligence; and he sees her from new points of\\\\r\\\\nview; he has also undisturbed leisure for the problems which perpetually\\\\r\\\\nattract his attention by their novelty. The consequence is, that though\\\\r\\\\nscientific travellers are comparatively few, yet out of their ranks a\\\\r\\\\nlarge proportion of the leaders in all branches of science has been\\\\r\\\\nsupplied. It is one of the most grateful results of a journey to the\\\\r\\\\nyoung traveller to find himself admitted, on the ground of his having so\\\\r\\\\nmuch of special interest to relate, into the society of men with whose\\\\r\\\\nnames he had long been familiar, and whom he had reverenced as his\\\\r\\\\nheroes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo obtain Information.--The centres of information respecting rude and\\\\r\\\\nsavage countries are the Geographical, Ethnological, and Anthropological\\\\r\\\\nsocieties at home and abroad. Any one intending to travel should put\\\\r\\\\nhimself into communication with the Secretary, and become a member of one\\\\r\\\\nor more of these Societies; he will not only have access to books and\\\\r\\\\nmaps, but will be sure to meet with sympathy, encouragement, and\\\\r\\\\nintelligent appreciation. If he is about to attempt a really bold\\\\r\\\\nexploration under fair conditions of success, he will no doubt be\\\\r\\\\nintroduced to the best living authorities on the country to which he is\\\\r\\\\nbound, and will be provided with letters of introduction to the officials\\\\r\\\\nat the port where he is to disembark, that will smooth away many small\\\\r\\\\ndifficulties and give him a recognised position during his travels.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInformation on Scientific Matters.--Owing to the unhappy system of\\\\r\\\\neducation that has hitherto prevailed, by which boys acquire a very\\\\r\\\\nimperfect knowledge of the structure of two dead languages, and none at\\\\r\\\\nall of the structure of the living world, most persons preparing to\\\\r\\\\ntravel are overwhelmed with the consciousness of their incapacity to\\\\r\\\\nobserve, with intelligence, the country they are about to visit. I have\\\\r\\\\nbeen very frequently begged by such persons to put them in the way of\\\\r\\\\nobtaining a rudimentary knowledge of the various branches of science, and\\\\r\\\\nhave constantly made inquiries; but I regret to say that I have been\\\\r\\\\nunable to discover any establishment where suitable instruction in\\\\r\\\\nnatural science is to be obtained by persons of the age and station of\\\\r\\\\nmost travellers. Nor do I know of any persons who advertise private\\\\r\\\\ntuition in any of its branches whose names I might therefore be at\\\\r\\\\nliberty to publish, except Professor Tennant, who gives private lessons\\\\r\\\\nin mineralogy at his shop in the Strand, where the learner might easily\\\\r\\\\nfamiliarise himself with the ordinary minerals and fossils, and where\\\\r\\\\ncollections might be purchased for after reference. An intending\\\\r\\\\ntraveller could readily find naturalists who would give lessons, in\\\\r\\\\nmuseums and botanical gardens, adapting their instruction to his probable\\\\r\\\\nwants, and he would thus obtain some familiarity with the character of\\\\r\\\\nthe principal plants and animals amongst which he would afterwards be\\\\r\\\\nthrown. If he has no private means of learning the names of such persons,\\\\r\\\\nI should recommend him to write to some public Professor, stating all\\\\r\\\\nparticulars, and begging the favour of his advice. The use of the sextant\\\\r\\\\nmay be learnt at various establishments in the City and East End of\\\\r\\\\nLondon, where the junior officers of merchant vessels receive instruction\\\\r\\\\nat small cost. A traveller could learn their addresses from the maker of\\\\r\\\\nhis sextant. He might also apply at the rooms of the Royal Geographical\\\\r\\\\nSociety, 1, Savile Row, London, where he would probably receive advice\\\\r\\\\nsuitable to his particular needs, and possibly some assistance of a\\\\r\\\\nsuperior order to that which the instructors of whom I spoke profess to\\\\r\\\\nafford. That well-known volume, 'The Admiralty Manual of Scientific\\\\r\\\\nInquiry,' has been written to meet the wants of uninformed travellers;\\\\r\\\\nand a small pamphlet, 'Hints to Travellers,' has been published with the\\\\r\\\\nsame object, by the Royal Geographical Society. It is procurable at their\\\\r\\\\nrooms. There is, perhaps, no branch of Natural History in which a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller could do so much, without more information than is to be\\\\r\\\\nobtained from a few books, than that of the Science of Man. He should see\\\\r\\\\nthe large collection of skulls in the College of Surgeons, and the flint\\\\r\\\\nand bone implements in the British Museum, the Christie Museum, and\\\\r\\\\nelsewhere, and he should buy the principal modern works on anthropology,\\\\r\\\\nto be carefully re-studied on his outward voyage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConditions of Success and Failure in Travel.--An exploring expedition is\\\\r\\\\ndaily exposed to a succession of accidents, any one of which might be\\\\r\\\\nfatal to its further progress. The cattle may at any time stray, die, or\\\\r\\\\nbe stolen; water may not be reached, and they may perish; one or more of\\\\r\\\\nthe men may become seriously ill, or the party may be attacked by\\\\r\\\\nnatives. Hence the success of the expedition depends on a chain of\\\\r\\\\neventualities, each link of which must be a success; for if one link\\\\r\\\\nfails at that point, there must be an end of further advance. It is\\\\r\\\\ntherefore well, especially at the outset of a long journey, not to go\\\\r\\\\nhurriedly to work, nor to push forward too thoughtlessly. Give the men\\\\r\\\\nand cattle time to become acclimatised, make the bush your home, and\\\\r\\\\navoid unnecessary hardships. Interest yourself chiefly in the progress of\\\\r\\\\nyour journey, and do not look forward to its end with eagerness. It is\\\\r\\\\nbetter to think of a return to civilisation, not as an end to hardship\\\\r\\\\nand a haven from ill, but as a close to an adventurous and pleasant life.\\\\r\\\\nIn this way, risking little, and insensibly creeping on, you will make\\\\r\\\\nconnections, and learn the capabilities of the country, as you advance;\\\\r\\\\nall which will be found invaluable in the case of a hurried or disastrous\\\\r\\\\nreturn. And thus, when some months have passed by, you will look back\\\\r\\\\nwith surprise on the great distance travelled over; for, if you average\\\\r\\\\nonly three miles a day, at the end of the year you will have advanced\\\\r\\\\n1200, which is a very considerable exploration. The fable of the Tortoise\\\\r\\\\nand the Hare is peculiarly applicable to travellers over wide and unknown\\\\r\\\\ntracts. It is a very high merit to accomplish a long exploration without\\\\r\\\\nloss of health, of papers, or even of comfort.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPhysical Strength of Leader.--Powerful men do not necessarily make the\\\\r\\\\nmost eminent travellers; it is rather those who take the most interest in\\\\r\\\\ntheir work that succeed the best; as a huntsman says, \\\\\\\"it is the nose\\\\r\\\\nthat gives speed to the hound.\\\\\\\" Dr. Kane, who was one of the most\\\\r\\\\nadventurous of travellers, was by no means a strong man, either in health\\\\r\\\\nor muscle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGood Temper.--Tedious journeys are apt to make companions irritable one\\\\r\\\\nto another; but under hard circumstances, a traveller does his duty best\\\\r\\\\nwho doubles his kindliness of manner to those about him, and takes harsh\\\\r\\\\nwords gently, and without retort. He should make it a point of duty to do\\\\r\\\\nso. It is at those times very superfluous to show too much\\\\r\\\\npunctiliousness about keeping up one's dignity, and so forth; since the\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty lies not in taking up quarrels, but in avoiding them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReluctant Servants.--Great allowance should be made for the reluctant\\\\r\\\\nco-operation of servants; they have infinitely less interest in the\\\\r\\\\nsuccess of the expedition than their leaders, for they derive but little\\\\r\\\\ncredit from it. They argue thus:--\\\\\\\"Why should we do more than we\\\\r\\\\nknowingly undertook, and strain our constitutions and peril our lives in\\\\r\\\\nenterprises about which we are indifferent?\\\\\\\" It will, perhaps, surprise a\\\\r\\\\nleader who, having ascertained to what frugal habits a bush servant is\\\\r\\\\ninured, learns on trial, how desperately he clings to those few luxuries\\\\r\\\\nwhich he has always had. Thus, speaking generally, a Cape servant is\\\\r\\\\nhappy on meat, coffee, and biscuit; but, if the coffee or biscuit has to\\\\r\\\\nbe stopped for a few days, he is ready for mutiny.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nORGANISING AN EXPEDITION.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSize of Party.--The best size for a party depends on many considerations.\\\\r\\\\nIt should admit of being divided into two parts, each strong enough to\\\\r\\\\ntake care of itself, and in each of which is one person at least able to\\\\r\\\\nwrite a letter,--which bus servants, excellent in every other particular,\\\\r\\\\nare too often unable to do. In travel through a disorganised country,\\\\r\\\\nwhere there are small chiefs and bands of marauders, a large party is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary; thus the great success of Livingstone's earlier expeditions\\\\r\\\\nwas largely due to his being provided with an unusually strong escort of\\\\r\\\\nwell-armed and warlike, but not too aggressive, Caffres. In other cases\\\\r\\\\nsmall parties succeed better than large ones; they excite less fear, do\\\\r\\\\nnot eat up the country, and are less delayed by illness. The last fatal\\\\r\\\\nexpedition of Mungo Park is full of warning to travellers who propose\\\\r\\\\nexploring with a large body of Europeans.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSolitary Travellers.--Neither sleepy nor deaf men are fit to travel quite\\\\r\\\\nalone. It is remarkable how often the qualities of wakefulness and\\\\r\\\\nwatchfulness stand every party in good stead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nServants.--Nature of Engagements.--The general duties that a servant\\\\r\\\\nshould be bound to, independently of those for which he is specially\\\\r\\\\nengaged, are--under penalty of his pay being stopped, and, it may be, of\\\\r\\\\ndismissal--to maintain discipline, take share of camp-duties and\\\\r\\\\nnight-watch, and do all in his power to promote the success of the\\\\r\\\\nexpedition. His wages should not be payable to him in full, till the\\\\r\\\\nreturn of the party to the town from which it started, or to some other\\\\r\\\\ncivilised place. It is best that all clothing, bedding, etc., that the\\\\r\\\\nmen may require, should be issued out and given to them as a present, and\\\\r\\\\nthat none of their own old clothes should be allowed to be taken. They\\\\r\\\\nare more careful of what is their own; and, by supplying the things\\\\r\\\\nyourself, you can be sure that they are good in quality, uniform in\\\\r\\\\nappearance, and equal in weight, while this last is ascertainable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe following Form of Agreement is abridged from one that was used in Mr.\\\\r\\\\nAustin's expedition in Australia. It seems short, explicit, and\\\\r\\\\nreasonable:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"We the undersigned, forming an expedition about to explore the interior\\\\r\\\\nof ----, under Mr. A., consent to place ourselves (horses and equipments)\\\\r\\\\nentirely and unreservedly under his orders for the above purpose, from\\\\r\\\\nthe date hereof until our return to----, or, on failure in this respect,\\\\r\\\\nto abide all consequences that may result. We fully recognise Mr. B. as\\\\r\\\\nthe second, and Mr. C. as the third in command; and the right of\\\\r\\\\nsuccession to the command and entire charge of the party in the order\\\\r\\\\nthus stated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"We severally undertake to use our best endeavours to promote the harmony\\\\r\\\\nof the party, and the success of the expedition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"In witness whereof we sign our names. (Here follow the signatures.) Read\\\\r\\\\nover and signed by the respective parties, in my presence.\\\\\\\" (Here follows\\\\r\\\\nthe signature of some person of importance in the place where the\\\\r\\\\nexpedition is organised.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the words, \\\\\\\"abide all consequences,\\\\\\\" the leader would be justified in\\\\r\\\\nleaving a man to shift for himself, and refusing his pay, if the case\\\\r\\\\nwere a serious one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGood Interpreters are very important: men who have been used by their\\\\r\\\\nchiefs, missionaries, etc., as interpreters, are much to be preferred;\\\\r\\\\nfor so great is the poverty of thought and language among common people,\\\\r\\\\nthat you will seldom find a man, taken at hazard, able to render your\\\\r\\\\nwords with correctness. Recollect to take with you vocabularies of all\\\\r\\\\nthe tribes whom you are at all likely to visit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEngaging Natives.--On engaging natives, the people with whom they have\\\\r\\\\nlived, and to whom they have become attached and learnt to fear, should\\\\r\\\\nimpress on them that, unless they bring you back in safety, they must\\\\r\\\\nnever show their faces again, nor expect the balance of their pay, which\\\\r\\\\nwill only be delivered to them on your return.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWomen.--Natives' Wives.--If some of the natives take their wives, it\\\\r\\\\ngives great life to the party. They are of very great service, and cause\\\\r\\\\nno delay; for the body of a caravan must always travel at a foot's pace,\\\\r\\\\nand a woman will endure a long journey nearly as well as a man, and\\\\r\\\\ncertainly better than a horse or a bullock. They are invaluable in\\\\r\\\\npicking up and retailing information and hearsay gossip, which will give\\\\r\\\\nclues to much of importance, that, unassisted, you might miss. Mr. Hearne\\\\r\\\\nthe American traveller of the last century, in his charming book, writes\\\\r\\\\nas follows, and I can fully corroborate the faithfulness with which he\\\\r\\\\ngives us a savage's view of the matter. After the account of his first\\\\r\\\\nattempt, which was unsuccessful, he goes on to say,--\\\\\\\"The very plan\\\\r\\\\nwhich, by the desire of the Governor, we pursued, of not taking any women\\\\r\\\\nwith us on the journey, was, as the chief said, the principal thing that\\\\r\\\\noccasioned all our want: 'for,' said he, 'when all the men are heavy\\\\r\\\\nladen, they can neither hunt nor travel to any considerable distance; and\\\\r\\\\nif they meet with any success in hunting, who is to carry the produce of\\\\r\\\\nthe labour?' 'Women,' said he, 'were made for labour: one of them can\\\\r\\\\ncarry or haul as much as two men can do. They also pitch our tents, make\\\\r\\\\nand mend our clothing, keep us warm at night; and in fact there is no\\\\r\\\\nsuch thing as travelling any considerable distance, or for any length of\\\\r\\\\ntime, in this country without their assistance.' 'Women,' said he again,\\\\r\\\\n'though they do everything are maintained at a trifling expense: for, as\\\\r\\\\nthey always stand cook, the very licking of their fingers, in scarce\\\\r\\\\ntimes, is sufficient for their subsistence.'\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStrength of Women.--I believe there are few greater popular errors than\\\\r\\\\nthe idea we have mainly derived from chivalrous times, that woman is a\\\\r\\\\nweakly creature. Julius C aesar, who judged for himself, took a very\\\\r\\\\ndifferent view of the powers of certain women of the northern races,\\\\r\\\\nabout whom he wrote. I suppose, that in the days of baronial castles,\\\\r\\\\nwhen crowds of people herded together like pigs within the narrow\\\\r\\\\nenclosures of a fortification and the ladies did nothing but needlework\\\\r\\\\nin their boudoirs, the mode of life wasvery prejudicial to their nervous\\\\r\\\\nsystem and muscular powers. The women suffered from the effects of ill\\\\r\\\\nventilation and bad drainage, and had none of the counteracting\\\\r\\\\nadvantages of the military life that was led by the males. Consequently\\\\r\\\\nwomen really became the helpless dolls that they were considered to be,\\\\r\\\\nand which it is still the fashion to consider them. It always seems to me\\\\r\\\\nthat a hard-worked woman is better and happier for her work. It is in the\\\\r\\\\nnature of women to be fond of carrying weights; you may see them in\\\\r\\\\nomnibuses and carriages, always preferring to hold their baskets or their\\\\r\\\\nbabies on their knees, to setting them down on the seats by their sides.\\\\r\\\\nA woman, whose modern dress includes I know not how many cubic feet of\\\\r\\\\nspace, has hardly ever pockets of a sufficient size to carry small\\\\r\\\\narticles; for she prefers to load her hands with a bag or other weighty\\\\r\\\\nobject. A nursery-maid, who is on the move all day, seems the happiest\\\\r\\\\nspecimen of her sex; and, after her, a maid-of-all work who is treated\\\\r\\\\nfairly by her mistress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOUTFIT.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is impossible to include lists of outfit, in any reasonable space,\\\\r\\\\nthat shall suit the various requirements of men engaged in expeditions of\\\\r\\\\ndifferent magnitudes, who adopt different modes of locomotion, and who\\\\r\\\\nvisit different countries and climates. I have therefore thought it best\\\\r\\\\nto describe only one outfit as a specimen, selecting for my example the\\\\r\\\\ndesiderata for South Africa. In that country the traveller has, or had a\\\\r\\\\nfew years ago, to take everything with him, for there were no civilised\\\\r\\\\nsettlers, and the natural products of the country are of as little value\\\\r\\\\nin supplying his wants as those of any country can be. Again, South\\\\r\\\\nAfrican wants are typical of those likely to be felt in every part of a\\\\r\\\\nlarge proportion of the region where rude travel is likely to be\\\\r\\\\nexperienced, as in North Africa, in Australia, in Southern Siberia, and\\\\r\\\\neven in the prairies and pampas of North and South America. To make such\\\\r\\\\nan expedition effective all the articles included in the following lists\\\\r\\\\nmay be considered as essential; I trust, on the other hand, that no\\\\r\\\\narticle of real importance is omitted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStores for general use.--These are to a great degree independent of the\\\\r\\\\nduration of the journey.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Stores, various: --                                        lbs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne or two very small soft-steel axes; a small file to\\\\r\\\\n    sharpen them; a few additional tools (see chapter on\\\\r\\\\n    Timber); spare butcher's knives..............................8\\\\r\\\\nA dozen awls for wood and for leather, two of them in\\\\r\\\\n    handles; two gimlets; a dozen sail-needles; three palms;\\\\r\\\\n    a ball of sewing-twine; bit of beeswax; sewing-needles,\\\\r\\\\n    assorted; a ball of black and white thread; buttons; two\\\\r\\\\n    tailors' thimbles (see chapter on Cord, String, and\\\\r\\\\n    Thread)......................................................3\\\\r\\\\nTwo penknives; small metal saw; bit of Turkey gone; large\\\\r\\\\n    scissors; corkscrew..........................................1 1/2\\\\r\\\\nSpring balances, from 1/4 lb. to 5 lbs. and from 1 lb. to\\\\r\\\\n    50 lbs.

It is a great mistake to suppose that savages will give\\\\r\\\\ntheir labour or cattle in return for anything that is bright or new: they\\\\r\\\\nhave their real wants and their fashions as much as we have; and, unless\\\\r\\\\nwhat a traveller brings, meets either the one or the other, he can get\\\\r\\\\nnothing from them, except through fear or compulsion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe necessities of a savage are soon satisfied; and, unless he belongs to\\\\r\\\\na nation civilised enough to live in permanent habitations, and secure\\\\r\\\\nfrom plunder, he cannot accumulate, but is only able to keep what he\\\\r\\\\nactually is able to carry about his own person. Thus, the chief at Lake\\\\r\\\\nNgami told Mr. Andersson that his beads would be of little use, for the\\\\r\\\\nwomen about the place already \\\\\\\"grunted like pigs\\\\\\\" under the burdens of\\\\r\\\\nthose that they wore, and which they had received from previous\\\\r\\\\ntravellers. These are matters of serious consideration to persons who\\\\r\\\\npropose to travel with a large party, and who must have proportionably\\\\r\\\\nlarge wants.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpeaking of presents and articles for payment, as of money, it is\\\\r\\\\nessential to have a great quantity and variety of small change, wherewith\\\\r\\\\nthe traveller can pay for small services, for carrying messages, for\\\\r\\\\ndraughts of milk, pieces of meat, etc. Beads, shells, tobacco, needles,\\\\r\\\\nawls, cotton caps, handkerchiefs, clasp-knives, small axes, spear and\\\\r\\\\narrow heads, generally answer this purpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere is infinite fastidiousness shown by savages in selecting beads,\\\\r\\\\nwhich, indeed, are their jewellery; so that valuable beads, taken at\\\\r\\\\nhap-hazard, are much more likely to prove failures than not. It would\\\\r\\\\nalways be well to take abundance (40 or 50 lbs. weight goes but a little\\\\r\\\\nway) of the following cheap beads, as they are very generally\\\\r\\\\naccepted,--dull white, dark blue, and vermilion red, all of a small size.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is the ignorance of what are the received articles of payment in a\\\\r\\\\ndistant country, and the using up of those that are taken, which, more\\\\r\\\\nthan any other cause, limits the journeyings of an explorer: the demands\\\\r\\\\nof each fresh chief are an immense drain upon his store.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSummary.--To know the minimum weight for which a proposed expedition must\\\\r\\\\nfind means of transport, the omitted figures must be supplied in the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing schedule, the others must be corrected where required, and the\\\\r\\\\nwhole must be added together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStores for general use:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVarious small stores                              95 lbs.\\\\r\\\\nVarious heavy stores\\\\r\\\\nStationery                                        30\\\\r\\\\nMapping                                           31\\\\r\\\\nNatural History (occasional)                      30\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStores for Individual use:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor each white man (at rate of 7 lbs. per month)  66\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor each black man (at rate of 3 lbs. per month   30\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPresents and articles of payment are usually of far\\\\r\\\\ngreater weight than all the above things put together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTOTAL WEIGHT TO BE CARRIED BY EXPEDITION         282\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMem.--If meat and bread, and the like, have to be carried, a very large\\\\r\\\\naddition of weight must be made to this list, for the weight of a daily\\\\r\\\\nration varies from 3 lbs., or even 4 lbs., to 2 lbs., according to the\\\\r\\\\nconcentration of nutriment in the food that is used. Slaughter animals\\\\r\\\\ncarry themselves; but the cattle-watchers swell the list of those who\\\\r\\\\nhave to be fed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeans of Transport.--In order to transport the articles belonging to an\\\\r\\\\nexpedition across a wild and unknown country, we may estimate as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeasts of burthen:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn ass will not usually care more than about (net weight) 65 lbs.\\\\r\\\\nA small mule                                              90\\\\r\\\\nA horse                                                  100\\\\r\\\\nAn ox of an average greed                                120\\\\r\\\\nA camel (which rarely can be used by an explorer)        300\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is very inconvenient to take more than six pack-animals in a caravan\\\\r\\\\nthat has to pass over broken country, for so much time is lost by the\\\\r\\\\nwhole party in re-adjusting the packs of each member of it, whenever one\\\\r\\\\ngets loose, that its progress is seriously retarded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarriages.--An animal--camels always excepted--draws upon wheels in a\\\\r\\\\nwild country about two and a half times the weight he can carry.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                                              lbs.\\\\r\\\\nA light cart, exclusive of the driver, should not carry\\\\r\\\\n    more than..................................................800\\\\r\\\\nA light waggon, such as one or two horses would trot\\\\r\\\\n    away with, along a turnpike road, not more than...........1500\\\\r\\\\nA waggon of the strongest construction, not more than.........3000\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWeight of Rations.--A fair estimate in commissariat matters is as follows:--\\\\r\\\\nA strong waggon full of food carries 1000 full-day rations\\\\r\\\\nThe pack of an ox             \\\\\\\"        40          \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nThe pack of a horse           \\\\\\\"        30          \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nA slaughter ox yields, as fresh meat   80          \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nA fat sheep yields            \\\\\\\"        10          \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n(N.B.  Meat when jerked loses about one-half of its nourishing powers.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMEDICINE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Travellers are apt to expect too much from their\\\\r\\\\nmedicines, and to think that savages will hail them as demigods wherever\\\\r\\\\nthey go. But their patients are generally cripples who want to be made\\\\r\\\\nwhole in a moment, and other suchlike impracticable cases. Powerful\\\\r\\\\nemetics, purgatives, and eyewashes are the most popular physickings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe traveller who is sick away from help, may console himself with the\\\\r\\\\nproverb, that \\\\\\\"though there is a great difference between a good\\\\r\\\\nphysician and a bad one, there is very little between a good one and none\\\\r\\\\nat all.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrugs and Instruments.--Outfit of Medicines,--A traveller, unless he be a\\\\r\\\\nprofessed physician, has no object in taking a large assortment of drugs.\\\\r\\\\nHe wants a few powders, ready prepared; which a physician, who knows the\\\\r\\\\ndiseases of the country in which he is about to travel, will prescribe\\\\r\\\\nfor him. Those in general use are as follows:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1. Emetic, mild; 2. ditto, very powerful, for poison (sulphate of zinc,\\\\r\\\\nalso used as an eye-wash in Ophthalmia). e. Aperient, mild; 4. ditto,\\\\r\\\\npowerful. 5. Cordial for diarrhoea. 6. Quinine for ague. 7. Sudorific\\\\r\\\\n(Dover's powder). 8. Chlorodyne. 9. Camphor. 10. Carbolic acid.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn addition to these powders, the traveller will want Warburg's\\\\r\\\\nfever-drops; glycerine or cold cream; mustard-paper for blistering;\\\\r\\\\nheartburn lozenges; lint; a small roll of diachylon; lunar-caustic, in a\\\\r\\\\nproper holder, to touch old sores with, and for snake-bites; a scalpel\\\\r\\\\nand a blunt-pointed bistoury, with which to open abcesses (the blades of\\\\r\\\\nthese should be waxed, to keep them from rust); a good pair of forceps,\\\\r\\\\nto pull out thorns; a couple of needles, to sew up gashes; waxed thread,\\\\r\\\\nor better, silver wire. A mild effervescing aperient, like Moxon's is\\\\r\\\\nvery convenient. Seidlitz-powders are perhaps a little too strong for\\\\r\\\\nfrequent use in a tropical climate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHow to carry Medicines.--The medicines should be kept in zinc pill-boxes\\\\r\\\\nwith a few letters punched both on their tops and bottoms, to indicate\\\\r\\\\nwhat they contain, as Emet., Astr. etc. It is more important that the\\\\r\\\\nbottoms of the boxes should be labelled than their tops; because when two\\\\r\\\\nof them have been opened at the same time, it often happens that the tops\\\\r\\\\nrun a risk of being changed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt will save continual trouble with weights and scales, if the powders be\\\\r\\\\nso diluted with flour, that one Measureful of each shall be a full\\\\r\\\\naverage dose for an adult; and if the measure to which they are adopted\\\\r\\\\nbe cylindrical, and of such a size as just to admit a common lead-pencil,\\\\r\\\\nand of a determined length, it can at any time be replaced by twisting up\\\\r\\\\na paper cartridge. I would further suggest that the powders be\\\\r\\\\ndifferently coloured, one colour being used for emetics and another for\\\\r\\\\naperients.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLint, to make.--Scrape a piece of linen with a knife.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOintment.--Simple cerate, which is spread on lint as a soothing plaister\\\\r\\\\nfor sores, consists of equal parts of oil and wax; but lard may be used\\\\r\\\\nas a substitute for the wax.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeidlitz-powders are not often to be procured in the form we are\\\\r\\\\naccustomed to take them in, in England; so a recipe for making 12 sets of\\\\r\\\\nthem, is annexed:--1 1/2 oz. of Carbonate of Soda and 3 oz. of Tartarised\\\\r\\\\nSoda, for the blue papers; 7 drachms of Tartaric Acid, for the white\\\\r\\\\npapers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBush Remedies.--Emetics.--For want of proper physic, drink a charge of\\\\r\\\\ngunpowder in a tumblerful of warm water of soap-suds, and tickle the\\\\r\\\\nthroat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVapour-baths are used in many countries, and the following plan, used in\\\\r\\\\nRussia, is often the most convenient. Heat stones in the fire, and put\\\\r\\\\nthem on the ground in the middle of the cabin or tent; on these pour a\\\\r\\\\nlittle water, and clouds of vapour are given off. In other parts of the\\\\r\\\\nworld branches are spread on hot wood-embers, and the patient is placed\\\\r\\\\nupon these, wrapped in a large cloth; water is then sprinkled on the\\\\r\\\\nembers, and the patient is soon covered with a cloud of vapour. The\\\\r\\\\ntraveller who is chilled or over-worked, and has a day of rest before\\\\r\\\\nhim, would do well to practise this simple and pleasant remedy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBleeding and Cupping'.--Physicians say, now-a-days that bleeding is\\\\r\\\\nrarely, if ever, required; and that frequently it does much harm; but\\\\r\\\\nthey used to bleed for everything. Many savages know how to cup: they\\\\r\\\\ncommonly use a piece ofa horn as the cup, and they either suck at a hole\\\\r\\\\nin the top of the horn, to produce the necessary vacuum, or they make a\\\\r\\\\nblaze as we do, but with a wisp of grass.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIllnesses.--Fevers of all kinds, diarrhoea, and rheumatism, are the\\\\r\\\\nplagues that most afflict travellers; ophthalmia often threatens them.\\\\r\\\\nChange of air, from the flat country up into the hills, as soon as the\\\\r\\\\nfirst violence of the illness is past, works wonders in hastening and\\\\r\\\\nperfecting a cure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFever.--The number of travellers that have fallen victims to fever in\\\\r\\\\ncertain lands is terrible: it is a matter of serious consideration\\\\r\\\\nwhether any motives, short of imperious duty, justify a person in braving\\\\r\\\\na fever-stricken country. In the ill-fated Niger expedition, three\\\\r\\\\nvessels were employed, of which the 'Albert' stayed the longest time in\\\\r\\\\nthe river, namely two months and two days. Her English crew consisted of\\\\r\\\\n62 men; of these, 55 caught fever in the river, and 23 died. Of the\\\\r\\\\nremaining seven, only two ultimately escaped scot-free; the others\\\\r\\\\nsuffering, more or less severely, on their return to England. In Dr.\\\\r\\\\nMcWilliams's Medical History of this expedition, it is laid down that the\\\\r\\\\nNiger fever, which may be considered as a type of pestilential fever\\\\r\\\\ngenerally, usually sets in sixteen days after exposure to the malaria;\\\\r\\\\nand that one attack, instead of acclimatising the patient, seems to\\\\r\\\\nrender him all the more liable to a second. Every conceivable precaution\\\\r\\\\nknown in those days, had been taken to ensure the health of the crew of\\\\r\\\\nthe 'Albert.' A great discovery of modern days is the power of quinine to\\\\r\\\\nkeep off many types of fever. A person would, now, have little to fear in\\\\r\\\\ntaking a passage in a Niger steamer; supposing that vessels ran regularly\\\\r\\\\nup that river. The quinine he would take, beginning at the coast, would\\\\r\\\\nrender him proof against fever, until he had passed the delta; but\\\\r\\\\nnothing would remove the risk of a long sojourn in the delta itself.\\\\r\\\\nHowever, I should add that Dr. Livingstone's experience on the zambesi\\\\r\\\\nthrows doubt on the power of quinine to keep off the type of fever that\\\\r\\\\nprevails upon that river.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrecautions in unhealthy Places.--There are certain precautions which\\\\r\\\\nshould be borne in mind in unhealthy places, besides that which I have\\\\r\\\\njust mentioned of regularly taking small doses of quinine, such as never\\\\r\\\\nto encamp to the leeward of a marsh; to sleep close in between large\\\\r\\\\nfires, with a handkerchief gathered round your face (natural instinct\\\\r\\\\nwill teach this); to avoid starting too early in the morning; and to\\\\r\\\\nbeware of unnecessary hunger, hardship, and exposure. It is a\\\\r\\\\nwidely-corroborated fact that the banks of a river and adjacent plains\\\\r\\\\nare often less affected by malaria than the low hills that overlook them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiarrhoea.--With a bad diarrhoea, take nothing but broth, rice water, and\\\\r\\\\nit may be rice, in very small quantities at a meal, until you are quite\\\\r\\\\nrestored. The least piece of bread or meat causes an immediate relapse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOphthalmia'.--Sulphate of zinc is invaluable as an eyewash: for\\\\r\\\\nophthalmia is a scourge in parts of North and South Africa, in Australia,\\\\r\\\\nand in many other countries. The taste of the solution which should be\\\\r\\\\nstrongly astringent, is the best guide to its strength.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTooth-ache.--Tough diet tries the teeth so severely, that a man about to\\\\r\\\\nundergo it, should pay a visit to a dentist before he leaves England. An\\\\r\\\\nunskilled traveller is very likely to make a bad job of a first attempt\\\\r\\\\nat tooth-drawing. By constantly pushing and pulling an aching tooth, it\\\\r\\\\nwill in time loosen, and perhaps, after some weeks, come out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThirst.--Pour water over the clothes of the patient, and keep them\\\\r\\\\nconstantly wet; restrain his drinking, after the first few minutes, as\\\\r\\\\nstrictly as you can summon heart to do it. (See \\\\\\\"Thirst\\\\\\\" in the chapter\\\\r\\\\non \\\\\\\"Water.\\\\\\\") In less severe cases, drink water with a tea-spoon; it will\\\\r\\\\nsatisfy a parched palate as much as if you gulped it down in tumblerfuls,\\\\r\\\\nand will disorder the digestion very considerably less.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHunger.--Give two or three mouthfuls, every quarter of an hour, to a man\\\\r\\\\nreduced to the last extremity by hunger; strong broth is the best food\\\\r\\\\nfor him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoisoning.--The first thing is to give a powerful emetic, that whatever\\\\r\\\\npoison still remains unabsorbed in the stomach, may be thrown up. Use\\\\r\\\\nsoap-suds or gunpowder (see Emetics) if proper emetics are not at hand.\\\\r\\\\nIf there be violent pains and gripings, or retchings, give plenty of\\\\r\\\\nwater to make the vomitings more easy. Next, do your best to combat the\\\\r\\\\nsymptoms that are caused by the poison which was absorbed before the\\\\r\\\\nemetic acted. Thus, if the man's feet are cold and numbed, put hot stones\\\\r\\\\nagainst them, and wrap them up warmly. If he be drowsy, heavy, and\\\\r\\\\nstupid, give brandy and strong coffee, and try to rouse him. There is\\\\r\\\\nnothing more to be done, save to avoid doing mischief.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFleas.--\\\\\\\"Italian flea-powder,\\\\\\\" sold in the East, is really efficacious.\\\\r\\\\nIt is the powdered \\\\\\\"Pire oti\\\\\\\" (or flea-bane), mentioned in Curzon's\\\\r\\\\n'Armenia' as growing in that country; it has since become an important\\\\r\\\\narticle of export. A correspondent writes to me, \\\\\\\"I have often found a\\\\r\\\\nlight cotton or linen bag a great safeguard against the attacks of fleas.\\\\r\\\\nI used to creep into it, draw the loop tight round my neck, and was thus\\\\r\\\\nable to set legions of them at defiance.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVermin on the Person.--I quote the following extract from Huc's 'Travels\\\\r\\\\nin Tartary':--\\\\\\\"We had now been travelling for nearly six weeks, and still\\\\r\\\\nwore the same clothing we had assumed on our departure. The incessant\\\\r\\\\npricklings with which we were harassed, sufficiently indicated that our\\\\r\\\\nattire was peopled with the filthy vermin to which the Chinese and\\\\r\\\\nTartars are familiarly accustomed; but which, with Europeans, are objects\\\\r\\\\nof horror and disgust. Before quitting Tchagan-Kouren, we had bought in a\\\\r\\\\nchemist's shop a few sapeks'-worth of mercury. We now made with it a\\\\r\\\\nprompt and specific remedy against the lice. We had formerly got the\\\\r\\\\nreceipt from some Chinese; and, as it may be useful to others, we think\\\\r\\\\nit right to describe it here. You take half an ounce of mercury, which\\\\r\\\\nyou mix with old tea-leaves previously reduced to paste by mastication.\\\\r\\\\nto render this softer, you generally add saliva; water could not have the\\\\r\\\\nsame effect. You must afterwards bruise and stir it a while, so that the\\\\r\\\\nmercury may be divided into little balls as fine as dust. (I presume the\\\\r\\\\nblue pill is a pretty exact equivalent to this preparation.) You infuse\\\\r\\\\nthis composition into a string of cotton, loosely twisted, which you hang\\\\r\\\\nround the neck; the lice are sure to bite at the bait, and they thereupon\\\\r\\\\nas surely swell, become red, and die forthwith. In China and in Tartary\\\\r\\\\nyou have to renew this salutary necklace once a month.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlistered Feet.--To prevent the feet from blistering, it is a good plan\\\\r\\\\nto soap the inside of the stocking before setting out, making a thick\\\\r\\\\nlather all over it. A raw egg broken into a boot, before putting it on,\\\\r\\\\ngreatly softens the leather: of course the boots should be well greased\\\\r\\\\nwhen hard walking is anticipated. After some hours on the road, when the\\\\r\\\\nfeet are beginning to be chafed, take off the shoes, and change the\\\\r\\\\nstockings; Putting what was the right stocking on the left foot, and the\\\\r\\\\nleft stocking on the right foot. Or, if one foot only hurts, take off the\\\\r\\\\nboot and turn the stocking inside out. These were the plans adopted by\\\\r\\\\nCaptain Barclay. when a blister is formed, \\\\\\\"rub the feet, on going to\\\\r\\\\nbed, with spirits mixed with tallow dropped from a candle into the palm\\\\r\\\\nof the hand; on the following morning no blister will exist. The spirits\\\\r\\\\nseem to possess the healing power, the tallow serving only to keep the\\\\r\\\\nskin soft and pliant. This is Captain Cochrane's advice, and the remedy\\\\r\\\\nwas used by him in his pedestrian tour.\\\\\\\" (Murray's Handbook of\\\\r\\\\nSwitzerland.') The recipe is an excellent one; pedestrians and teachers\\\\r\\\\nof gymnastics all endorse it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRarefied Air, effects of.--On high plateaux or mountains new-comers must\\\\r\\\\nexpect to suffer. The symptoms are described by many South American\\\\r\\\\ntravellers; the attack of them is there, among other names, called the\\\\r\\\\npuna. The disorder is sometimes fatal to stout plethoric people; oddly\\\\r\\\\nenough, cats are unable to endure it: at villages 13,000 feet above the\\\\r\\\\nsea, Dr. Tschudi says that they cannot live. Numerous trials have been\\\\r\\\\nmade with these unhappy feline barometers, and the creatures have been\\\\r\\\\nfound to die in frightful convulsions. The symptoms of the puna are\\\\r\\\\ngiddiness, dimness of sight and hearing, headache, fainting-fits, blood\\\\r\\\\nfrom mouth, eyes, nose, lips, and a feeling like sea-sickness. Nothing\\\\r\\\\nbut time cures it. It begins to be felt severely at from 12,000 to 13,000\\\\r\\\\nfeet above the sea. M. Hermann Schlagintweit, who has had a great deal of\\\\r\\\\nmountain experience in the Alps and in the Himalayas, up to the height of\\\\r\\\\n20,000 feet or more, tells me that he found the headache, etc., come on\\\\r\\\\nwhen there was a breeze, far more than at any other time. His whole party\\\\r\\\\nwould awake at the same moment, and begin to complain of the symptoms,\\\\r\\\\nimmediately on the commencement of a breeze. The symptoms of overwork are\\\\r\\\\nnot wholly unlike those of the puna, and many young travellers who have\\\\r\\\\nfelt the first, have ascribed them to the second.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScurvy has attacked travellers even in Australia; and I have myself felt\\\\r\\\\nsymptoms of it in Africa, when living wholly on meat. Any vegetable diet\\\\r\\\\ncures it: lime-juice, treacle, raw potatoes, and acid fruits are\\\\r\\\\nespecially efficacious. Dr. Kane insists on the value of entirely raw\\\\r\\\\nmeat as a certain anti-scorbutic: this is generally used by the\\\\r\\\\nEsquimaux.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHaemorrhage from a Wound.--When the blood does not pour or trickle in a\\\\r\\\\nsteady stream from a deep wound, but jets forth in pulses, and is of a\\\\r\\\\nbright red colour, all the bandages in the world will not stop it. It is\\\\r\\\\nan artery that is wounded; and, unless there be some one accessible, who\\\\r\\\\nknows how to take it up and tie it, I suppose that the method of our\\\\r\\\\nfore-fathers is the only one that can be used as you would for a\\\\r\\\\nsnake-bite (see next paragraph); or else to pour boiling grease into the\\\\r\\\\nwound. This is, of course, a barbarous treatment, and its success is\\\\r\\\\nuncertain, as the cauterised artery may break out afresh; still, life is\\\\r\\\\nin question, and it is the only hope of saving it. After the cautery, the\\\\r\\\\nwounded limb should be kept perfectly still, well raised, and cool, until\\\\r\\\\nthe wound is nearly healed. A tourniquet, which will stop the blood for a\\\\r\\\\ntime, is made by tying a strong thong, string, or handkerchief firmly\\\\r\\\\nabove the part, putting a stick through, and screwing it tight. If you\\\\r\\\\nknow whereabouts the artery lies, which is the object to compress, put a\\\\r\\\\nstone over the place under the handkerchief. The main arteries follow\\\\r\\\\npretty much the direction of the inner seams of the sleeves and trousers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnake-bites.--Tie a string tight above the part, suck the wound, and\\\\r\\\\ncaustic it as soon as you can. Or, for want of caustic, explode gunpowder\\\\r\\\\nin the wound; of else do what Mr. Mansfield Parkyns well suggests, i.e.,\\\\r\\\\ncut away with a knife, and afterwards burn out with the end of your iron\\\\r\\\\nramrod, heated as near a white heat as you can readily get it. The\\\\r\\\\narteries lie deep, and as much flesh may, without much danger, be cut or\\\\r\\\\nburnt into, as the fingers can pinch up. The next step is to use the\\\\r\\\\nutmost energy, and even cruelty, to prevent the patient's giving way to\\\\r\\\\nthat lethargy and drowsiness which is the usual effect of snake-poison,\\\\r\\\\nand too often ends in death.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWasp and Scorpion-stings.--the Oil scraped out of a tobacco-pipe is a\\\\r\\\\ngood application; should the scorpion be large, his sting must be treated\\\\r\\\\nlike a snake-bite.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBroken Bones.--It is extremely improbable that a man should die, in\\\\r\\\\nconsequence of a broken leg or arm, if the skin be uninjured' but, if the\\\\r\\\\nbroken end forces its way through the flesh, the injury is a very serious\\\\r\\\\none. Abscesses form, the parts mortify, and the severest consequences\\\\r\\\\noften follow. Hence, when a man breaks a bone, do not convert a simple\\\\r\\\\ninjury into a severe one, by carrying him carelessly. If possible, move\\\\r\\\\nthe encampment to the injured man, and not vice versa. Mr. Druitt\\\\r\\\\nsays:--\\\\\\\"When a man has broken his leg, lay him on the other side, put the\\\\r\\\\nbroken limb exactly on the sound one, with a little straw between, and\\\\r\\\\ntie the two legs together with handkerchiefs. Thus the two legs will move\\\\r\\\\nas one, and the broken bone will not hurt the flesh so much, nor yet come\\\\r\\\\nthrough the skin.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrowning.--A half-drowned man must be put to bed in dry, heated clothes,\\\\r\\\\nhot stones, etc., placed against his feet, and his head must be raised\\\\r\\\\nmoderately. Human warmth is excellent, such as that of two big men made\\\\r\\\\nto lie close up against him, one on each side. All rough treatment is not\\\\r\\\\nonly ridiculous but full of harm; such as the fashion--which still exists\\\\r\\\\nin some places--of hanging up the body by the feet, that the swallowed\\\\r\\\\nwater may drain out of the mouth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI reprint here the instructions circulated by Dr. Marshall Hall:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"1. Treat the patient instantly, on the spot, in the open air, exposing\\\\r\\\\nthe face and chest to the breeze (except in severe weather).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"To Clear the Throat--2. Place the patient gently on the face, with one\\\\r\\\\nwrist under the forehead; all fluids and the tongue itself then fall\\\\r\\\\nforwards, leaving the entrance into the windpipe free. If there be\\\\r\\\\nbreathing--wait and watch; if not, or if it fail,--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"To Excite Respiration--3. Turn the patient well and instantly on his\\\\r\\\\nside, and--4. Excite the nostrils with snuff, the throat with a feather,\\\\r\\\\netc., dash cold water on the face previously rubbed warm. If there be no\\\\r\\\\nsuccess, lose not a moment but instantly--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"To Imitate Respiration--5. Replace the patient on his face, raising and\\\\r\\\\nsupporting the chest well on a folded coat or other article of dress;--6.\\\\r\\\\nTurn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond, and then\\\\r\\\\nbriskly on the face, alternately; repeating these measures deliberately,\\\\r\\\\nefficiently, and perseveringly fifteen times in the minute, occasionally\\\\r\\\\nvarying the side; when the patient reposes on the chest, this cavity is\\\\r\\\\ncompressed by the weight of the body, and expiration takes place; when he\\\\r\\\\nis turned on the side, this pressure is removed, and inspiration occurs.\\\\r\\\\n7. when the prone position is resumed, make equable but efficient\\\\r\\\\npressure, with brisk movement, along the back of the chest; removing it\\\\r\\\\nimmediately before rotation on the side: the first measure augments the\\\\r\\\\nexpiration, the second commences inspiration. The result\\\\r\\\\nis--Respiration;--and, if not too late,--Life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"To induce Circulation and Warmth--8. Rub the limbs upwards, with firm\\\\r\\\\ngrasping pressure and with energy, using handkerchiefs, etc. by this\\\\r\\\\nmeasure the blood is propelled along the veins towards the heart. 9. Let\\\\r\\\\nthe limbs be thus dried and warmed, and then clothed, the bystanders\\\\r\\\\nsupplying coats, waistcoats, etc. 10.. Avoid the continuous warm-bath,\\\\r\\\\nand the position on or inclined to the back.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLitter for the Wounded.--If a man be wounded or sick, and has to be\\\\r\\\\ncarried upon the shoulders of others, make a little for him in the Indian\\\\r\\\\nfashion; that is to say, cut two stout poles, each 8 feet long, to make\\\\r\\\\nits two sides, and three other cross-bars of 2 1/2 feet each, to be\\\\r\\\\nlashed to them. Then supporting this ladder-shaped framework over the\\\\r\\\\nsick man as he lies in his blanket, knot the blanket up well to it, and\\\\r\\\\nso carry him off palanquin-fashion. One cross-bar will be just behind his\\\\r\\\\nhead, another in front of his feet; the middle one will cross his\\\\r\\\\nstomach, and keep him from falling out; and there will remain two short\\\\r\\\\nhandles for the carriers to lay hold of. The American Indians carry their\\\\r\\\\nwounded companions by this contrivance after a fight, and during a\\\\r\\\\nhurried retreat, for wonderful distances. A king of waggon-roof top can\\\\r\\\\neasily be made to it, with bent boughs and one spare blanket. (See\\\\r\\\\nPalanquin.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Black and white sketch of two 'Indians' carrying litter].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSURVEYING INSTRUMENTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn previous editions I reprinted here, with a few trifling alterations,\\\\r\\\\npart of a paper that I originally communicated to the Royal Geographical\\\\r\\\\nSociety, and which will be found at the end of their volume for 1854. In\\\\r\\\\naddition to it, communications are published there from Lieutenant Raper,\\\\r\\\\nAdmiral FitzRoy, Admiral Smyth, Admiral Beechey, and Colonel Sykes; the\\\\r\\\\nwhole of which was collected under the title of 'Hints to Travellers;'\\\\r\\\\nthey were printed in a separate form and widely circulated. When the\\\\r\\\\nedition was exhausted, a fresh Committee was appointed by the Council of\\\\r\\\\nthe Royal Geographical society, consisting of Admiral sir George Back,\\\\r\\\\nAdmiral R. Collinson, and myself, to revise the pamphlet thoroughly. This\\\\r\\\\nprocess was again gone through in 1871, and now the pamphlet is so much\\\\r\\\\namended and enlarged that I should do no good by making extracts. It is\\\\r\\\\nmuch better that intending travellers should apply for this third edition\\\\r\\\\nof the 'Hints to Travellers' at the society's rooms, 1, Savile Row: for\\\\r\\\\nit gives a great deal of information upon instruments that they would\\\\r\\\\nfind of real value. Its price is 1s.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPorters for delicate Instruments.--Entrust surveying instruments and\\\\r\\\\nfragile articles to come respectable old savage, whose infirmities compel\\\\r\\\\nhim to walk steadily. He will be delighted at the prospect of picking up\\\\r\\\\na living by such easy service.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeasuring low angles by reflexion.--an ordinary artificial horizon is\\\\r\\\\nuseless for very low angles. They can be measured to within two or three\\\\r\\\\nminutes, by means of a vertical point of reference obtained in the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing manner:--Tie two pieces of thread, crossing each other at two\\\\r\\\\nfeet above the ground, put the vessel of mercury underneath it, and look\\\\r\\\\ndown upon the mercury. When the eye is so placed, that the crossed\\\\r\\\\nthreads exactly cover their reflexion, the line of sight is truly\\\\r\\\\nvertical; and, if the distant object be brought down to them by the\\\\r\\\\nsextant, the angle read off will be 90 degrees + altitude. Captain\\\\r\\\\nGeorge's arrangement of glass floating on mercury (made by Cary, Fleet\\\\r\\\\nStreet, London), allows of very low angles being observed, but the use of\\\\r\\\\nthis instrument requires considerable caution as to the purity of the\\\\r\\\\nmercury and the cleanliness of the glass.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitute for glass roof to Horizon.--For want of a glass roof to place\\\\r\\\\nover the mercury a piece of gauze stretched over the vessel will answer\\\\r\\\\nvery tolerably for the purpose of keeping off the wind. The diameter of\\\\r\\\\nthe pupil of the eye is so large, compared to the thickness of the\\\\r\\\\nthreads of the gauze, that the latter offer little impediment to a clear\\\\r\\\\nview of the image.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSilvering Glasses for Sextants.--\\\\\\\"Before taking leave of this subject it\\\\r\\\\nmay not be unimportant to describe the operation of silvering the glasses\\\\r\\\\nof sextants, as those employed on surveying duties very frequently have\\\\r\\\\nto perform the operation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The requisites are clean tinfoil and mercury (a hare's foot is\\\\r\\\\nhandy)--lay the tinfoil, which should exceed the surface of the glass by\\\\r\\\\na quarter of an inch on each side, on a smooth surface (the back of a\\\\r\\\\nbook), rub it out smooth with the finger, add a bubble of mercury, about\\\\r\\\\nthe size of a small shot, which rub gently over the tinfoil until it\\\\r\\\\nspreads itself and shows a silvered surface, gently add sufficient\\\\r\\\\nmercury to cover the leaf so that its surface is fluid. Prepare a slip of\\\\r\\\\npaper the size of the tinfoil. Take the glass in the left hand,\\\\r\\\\npreviously well cleaned, and the paper in the right. Brush the surface of\\\\r\\\\nthe mercury gently to free it from dross. Lay the paper on the mercury,\\\\r\\\\nand the glass on it. Pressing gently on the glass, withdraw the paper.\\\\r\\\\nturn the glass on its face, and leave it on an inclined plane to allow\\\\r\\\\nthe mercury to flow off, which is accelerated by laying a strip of\\\\r\\\\ntinfoil as a conductor to its lower edge. The edges may, after twelve\\\\r\\\\nhours' rest, be removed. In twenty-four hours give it a coat of varnish,\\\\r\\\\nmade from spirits of wine and red sealing-wax. It may be as well to\\\\r\\\\npractise on small bits of common glass, which will soon prove the degree\\\\r\\\\nof perfection which the operator has attained.\\\\\\\" (Admiral Sir E. Belcher.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMEMORANDA AND LOG-BOOKS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBest form for Memoranda.--I have remarked that almost every traveller who\\\\r\\\\nis distinguished for the copiousness and accuracy of his journals, has\\\\r\\\\nwritten them in a remarkably small but distinct handwriting. Hard\\\\r\\\\npencil-marks (HHH pencils) on common paper, or on metallic paper are very\\\\r\\\\ndurable. Dr. Barth wrote his numerous observations entirely in\\\\r\\\\nIndian-ink. He kept a tiny saucer in his pocket, rubbed with the ink;\\\\r\\\\nwhen he wanted to use it, he rubbed it up with his wetted finger-tip, or\\\\r\\\\nresupplied it with fresh ink, and filled his pen and wrote. Captain\\\\r\\\\nBurton wrote very much in the dark, when lying awake at night; he used a\\\\r\\\\nboard with prominent lines of wood, such as is adopted by the blind. It\\\\r\\\\nis very important that what is written should be intelligible to a\\\\r\\\\nstranger after a long lapse of time. A traveller may die, and his\\\\r\\\\nuncompleted work perish with him; or he may return, and years will pass\\\\r\\\\nby, and suddenly some observations he had made will be called in\\\\r\\\\nquestion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProfessor J. Forbes says:--\\\\\\\"The practice which I have long adopted is\\\\r\\\\nthis:--to carry a memorandum-book with Harwood's prepared paper\\\\\\\" (in this\\\\r\\\\npoint of detail I do not concur; see next paragraph) \\\\\\\"and metallic\\\\r\\\\npencil, in which notes and observations and slight sketches of every\\\\r\\\\ndescription, are made on the spot, and in the exact order in which they\\\\r\\\\noccur. These notes are almost ineffaceable, and are preserved for\\\\r\\\\nreference. They are then extended, as far as possible, every evening with\\\\r\\\\npen and ink, in a suitable book, in the form of a journal; from which,\\\\r\\\\nfinally, they may be extracted and modified for any ultimate purpose. The\\\\r\\\\nspeedy extension of memoranda has several great advantages: it secures a\\\\r\\\\ndeliberate revision of observations, whether of instruments or of nature,\\\\r\\\\nwhilst further explanation may be sought, and very often whilst\\\\r\\\\nambiguities or contradictions admit of removal by a fresh appeal to\\\\r\\\\nfacts. By this precaution, too, the risk of losing all the fruits of some\\\\r\\\\nweeks of labour, by the loss of a pocket-book, may be avoided.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt has occurred to me, frequently, to be consulted about the best was of\\\\r\\\\nkeeping MSS. Captain Blakiston, who surveyed the northern part of the\\\\r\\\\nRocky Mountains, and subsequently received the medal of the Royal\\\\r\\\\nGeographical Society, for his exploration and admirable map of the\\\\r\\\\nYang-tse-Kiang, in China, paid great attention to the subject: he was\\\\r\\\\nfully in possession of all I had to say on the matter; and I gladly quote\\\\r\\\\nthe method he adopted in North America, with slight modifications,\\\\r\\\\naccording to the results of his experience, and with a few trivial\\\\r\\\\nadditions of my own. For the purposes of memoranda and mapping data, he\\\\r\\\\nuses three sets of books, which can be ordered at any lithographer's:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 1. pocket Memorandum Book, measuring three inches and a half by five,\\\\r\\\\nmade of strong paper. (Captain Blakston did not use, and I should not\\\\r\\\\nadvise travellers to use, \\\\\\\"prepared\\\\\\\" paper, for it soon becomes rotten,\\\\r\\\\nand the leaves fall out; besides that, wet makes the paper soppy.) The\\\\r\\\\nbooks are paged with bold numbers printed in the corners; two faint red\\\\r\\\\nlines are ruled down the middle of each page, half an inch apart, to\\\\r\\\\nenable the book to be used as a field-surveyor's book when required. In\\\\r\\\\nthis pocket=book, every single thing that is recorded at all, is\\\\r\\\\noriginally recorded with a hard HHH pencil. Everything is written\\\\r\\\\nconsecutively, without confusion or attempt to save space. There may\\\\r\\\\neasily be 150 pages in each of these books; and a sufficient number\\\\r\\\\nshould be procured to admit of having at least one per month. Do not\\\\r\\\\nstint yourself in these.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 2. Log-Book.--This is an orderly way of collecting such parts of the\\\\r\\\\nsurveying material as has been scattered over each day in your note-book.\\\\r\\\\nIt is to be neatly written out, and will become the standard of future\\\\r\\\\nreference. By using a printed form, the labour of drawing up the log on\\\\r\\\\nthe one hand, and that of consulting it on the other, will be vastly\\\\r\\\\ndiminished. I give Captain Blakiston's form, in pages 28, 29, and I would\\\\r\\\\nurge intending travellers not to depart from it without very valid\\\\r\\\\nreasons, for it is the result of considerable care and experience. The\\\\r\\\\nsize in which the form is printed here is not quite accurate, because the\\\\r\\\\npages of this book are not large enough to admit of it, but the\\\\r\\\\nproportion is kept. The actual size is intended to be five and a half\\\\r\\\\ninches high and nine inches wide, so that it should open freely along one\\\\r\\\\nof the narrow sides of the page, in the way that all memoranda books\\\\r\\\\nought to open. Four pages go to a day; of these the pages 1 and 2 are\\\\r\\\\nalone represented in this book, pages 3 and 4 being intended to be left\\\\r\\\\nblank.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[P 28 and p 29 show samples of the log book pages being described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe bold figures 17 and 18 in the right-hand corners of the form I give,\\\\r\\\\nshow how the pages should be numbered. The lines in p. 18 should be faint\\\\r\\\\nblue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 3. Calculation Book.--This should be of the same size and shape as\\\\r\\\\nthe Log Book, and should contain outline forms for calculations. The\\\\r\\\\nlabour and confusion saved by using these, and the accuracy of work that\\\\r\\\\nthey ensure, are truly remarkable. The instruments used, the observations\\\\r\\\\nmade, and especially the tables employed, are so exceedingly diverse,\\\\r\\\\nthat I fear it would be to little purpose if I were to give special\\\\r\\\\nexamples: each traveller must suit himself. I will, therefore, simply\\\\r\\\\nmake a few general remarks on this subject, in the following paragraph.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNumber of Observations requiring record.--A traveller does excellently,\\\\r\\\\nwho takes latitudes by meridian altitudes, once in the twenty-four hours;\\\\r\\\\na careful series of lunars once a fortnight, on an average; compass\\\\r\\\\nvariations as often; and an occulation now and then. He will want,\\\\r\\\\noccasionally, a time observation by which to set his watch (I am\\\\r\\\\nsupposing he uses no chronometer). He ought therefore to provide himself\\\\r\\\\nwith outline forms for calculating these observations, even if he finds\\\\r\\\\nhimself obliged to have them printed or lithographed on purpose; and in\\\\r\\\\npreparing them, he should bear the following well-known maxims in mind:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLet all careful observations be in doubles. If they be for latitudes,\\\\r\\\\nobserve a star N. and a star S.; the errors of your instruments will then\\\\r\\\\naffect the results in opposite directions, and the mean of the results\\\\r\\\\nwill destroy the error. So, if for time, observe in doubles, viz., a star\\\\r\\\\nE. and a star W. Also, if for lunars, let your sets be in doubles--one\\\\r\\\\nset of distances to a star E. of moon, and one to a star W. of moon.\\\\r\\\\nWhenever you begin on lunars, give three hours at least to them, and\\\\r\\\\nbring away a reliable series; you will be thus possessed of a certainty\\\\r\\\\nto work upon, instead of the miserably unsatisfactory results obtained\\\\r\\\\nfrom a single set of lunars taken here and another set there, scattered\\\\r\\\\nall over the country, and impossible to correlate. A series should\\\\r\\\\nconsist of six sets, each set including three simple distances. Three of\\\\r\\\\nthese sets should be to a star or stars E. of moon, and three to a star\\\\r\\\\nor stars W. of moon. Lunars not taken on the E. and W. plan are almost\\\\r\\\\nworthless, no matter how numerous they may be, for the sextant, etc.,\\\\r\\\\nmight be inaccurate to any amount, and yet no error be manifest in their\\\\r\\\\nresults. But the E. and W. plan exposes errors mercilessly, and also\\\\r\\\\neliminates them. One of the best authorities on the requirements of\\\\r\\\\nsextant observations in rude land travel, the Astronomer Royal of Cape\\\\r\\\\nTown, says to this effect:--\\\\\\\"Do not observe the altitude of the star in\\\\r\\\\ntaking lunars, but compute it. The labour requisite for that observation\\\\r\\\\nis better bestowed in taking a large number of distances.\\\\\\\" So much\\\\r\\\\ndelicacy of hand and of eyesight is requisite in taking lunars that shall\\\\r\\\\ngive results reliable to seven or eight miles, and so small an exertion\\\\r\\\\nor flurry spoils that delicacy, that economy of labour and fidget is a\\\\r\\\\nmatter to be carefully studied.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThese things being premised, it will be readily understood that outline\\\\r\\\\nforms sufficient for an entire series of lunars will extend over many\\\\r\\\\npages--they will, in fact, require eighteen pages. There are four sets of\\\\r\\\\nobservations for time:--one E. and one W., both at beginning and close of\\\\r\\\\nthe whole; one for latitudes N. and S.; six for six sets of lunars, as\\\\r\\\\ndescribed above; six for the corresponding altitudes of the stars, which\\\\r\\\\nhave to be computed; and, finally, one page for taking means, and\\\\r\\\\nrecording the observations for adjustment, etc. Each double observation\\\\r\\\\nfor latitude would take one page; each single time observation one page;\\\\r\\\\nand each single compass variation one page. An occulation would require\\\\r\\\\nthree pages in all; one of which would be for time. At this rate, and\\\\r\\\\ntaking the observations mentioned above, a book of 500 pages would last\\\\r\\\\nhalf a year. Of course where the means of transport is limited,\\\\r\\\\ntravellers must content themselves with less. Thus Captain Speke, who\\\\r\\\\nstarted on his great journey amply equipped with log-books and\\\\r\\\\ncalculation-books, such as I have described, found them too great an\\\\r\\\\nincumbrance, and was compelled to abandon them. The result was, that\\\\r\\\\nthough he brought back a very large number of laborious observations,\\\\r\\\\nthere was a want of method in them, which made a considerable part of his\\\\r\\\\nwork of little or no use, while the rest required very careful treatment,\\\\r\\\\nin order to give results commensurate with their high intrinsic value.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMEASUREMENTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDistance.--To measure the Length of a Journey by Time.--The pace of a\\\\r\\\\ncaravan across average country is 2 1/2 statute, or 2 geographical, miles\\\\r\\\\nper hour, as measured with compasses from point to point, and not\\\\r\\\\nfollowing the sinuosities of each day's course; but in making this\\\\r\\\\nestimate, every minute lost in stoppages by the way is supposed to be\\\\r\\\\nsubtracted from the whole time spent on the road. A careful traveller\\\\r\\\\nwill be surprised at the accuracy of the geographical results, obtainable\\\\r\\\\nby noting the time he has employed in actual travel. Experience shows\\\\r\\\\nthat 10 English miles per day, measured along the road--or, what is much\\\\r\\\\nthe same thing, 7 geographical miles, measured with a pair of compasses\\\\r\\\\nfrom point to point--is, taking one day with another, and including all\\\\r\\\\nstoppages of every kind, whatever be their cause,--very fast travelling\\\\r\\\\nfor a caravan. In estimating the probable duration of a journey in an\\\\r\\\\nunknown country, or in arranging an outfit for an exploring expedition,\\\\r\\\\nnot more than half that speed should be reckoned upon. Indeed, it would\\\\r\\\\nbe creditable to an explorer to have conducted the same caravan for a\\\\r\\\\ndistance of 1000 geographical miles, across a rude country, in six\\\\r\\\\nmonths. These data have, of course, no reference to a journey which may\\\\r\\\\nbe accomplished by a single great effort, nor to one where the\\\\r\\\\nwatering-places and pasturages are well known; but apply to an\\\\r\\\\nexploration of considerable length, in which a traveller must feel his\\\\r\\\\nway, and where he must use great caution not to exhaust his cattle, lest\\\\r\\\\nsome unexpected call for exertion should arise, which they might prove\\\\r\\\\nunequal to meet. Persons who have never travelled--and very many of those\\\\r\\\\nwho have, from neglecting to analyse their own performances--entertain\\\\r\\\\nvery erroneous views on these matters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRate of Movement to measure.--a. When the length of pace etc., is known\\\\r\\\\nbefore beginning, to observe.--A man or a horse walking at the rate of\\\\r\\\\none mile per hour, takes 10 paces in some ascertainable number of\\\\r\\\\nseconds, dependent upon the length of his step. If the length of his step\\\\r\\\\nbe 30 inches, he will occupy 17 seconds in making 10 paces. Conversely,\\\\r\\\\nif the same person counts his paces for 17 seconds, and finds that he has\\\\r\\\\ntaken 10 in that time, he will know that he is walking at the rate of\\\\r\\\\nexactly 1 mile per hour. If he had taken 40 paces in the same period, he\\\\r\\\\nwould know that his rate had been 4 miles per hour; if 35 paces, that it\\\\r\\\\nhad been 3.5, or 3 1/2 miles per hour. Thus it will be easily\\\\r\\\\nintelligible, that if a man knows the number of seconds appropriate to\\\\r\\\\nthe length of his pace, he can learn the rate at which he is walking, by\\\\r\\\\ncounting his paces during that number of seconds and by dividing the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of his paces so obtained, by 10. In short the number of his paces\\\\r\\\\nduring the period in question, gives his rate per hour, in miles and\\\\r\\\\ndecimals of a mile, to one place of decimals. I am indebted to Mr.\\\\r\\\\nArchibald Smith for this very ingenious notion, which I have worked into\\\\r\\\\nthe following Tables. In Table I., I give the appropriate number of\\\\r\\\\nseconds corresponding to paces of various lengths. I find, however, that\\\\r\\\\nthe pace of neither man nor horse is constant in length during all rates\\\\r\\\\nof walking; consequently, where precision is sought, it is better to use\\\\r\\\\nthis Table on a method of approximation. That is to say, the traveller\\\\r\\\\nshould find his approximate rate by using the number of seconds\\\\r\\\\nappropriate to his estimated speed. Then, knowing the length of pace due\\\\r\\\\nto that approximate rate, he will proceed afresh by adopting a revised\\\\r\\\\nnumber of seconds, and will obtain a result much nearer to the truth than\\\\r\\\\nthe first. Table I. could of course be employed for finding the rate of a\\\\r\\\\ncarriage, when the circumference of one of its wheels was known; but it\\\\r\\\\nis troublesome to make such a measurement. I therefore have calculated\\\\r\\\\nTable II., in terms of the radius of the wheel. The formulae by which\\\\r\\\\nthe two Tables have been calculated are, m=l x 0.5682 for Table I., and\\\\r\\\\nm=r x 3.570 for Table II., where m is the appropriate number of seconds;\\\\r\\\\nl is the length of the pace, or circumference of the wheel; and r is the\\\\r\\\\nradius of the wheel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Tables will be found on the next page.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Tables I and II appear on p 34].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nb. When the length of Pace is unknown till after observation.--In this\\\\r\\\\ncase, the following plan gives the rate of travel per hour, with the\\\\r\\\\nsmallest amount of arithmetic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor statute miles per hour--Observe the number of paces (n) taken in 5.7\\\\r\\\\nseconds: let i be the number of inches (to be subsequently determined at\\\\r\\\\nleisure) in a single pace; then ni/100 is the rate per hour.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor geographical miles per hour--The number of seconds to be employed is\\\\r\\\\n5. This formula is therefore very simple, and it is a useful one. (A\\\\r\\\\nstatute mile is 1760 yards, and a geographical mile is 2025 yards.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor finding the rate in statute miles per hour in a carriage--Observe\\\\r\\\\nthe number of revolutions (n) made by the wheel in 18 seconds: let d be\\\\r\\\\nthe number of inches in the diameter of the wheel; then n d/200 is the\\\\r\\\\nrate per hour.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe above method is convenient for measuring the rate at which an animal\\\\r\\\\ngallops. After counting its paces it may be through a telescope, during\\\\r\\\\nthe prescribed number of seconds, you walk to the track, and measure the\\\\r\\\\nlength of its pace. If you have no measuring tape, stride in yards\\\\r\\\\nalongside its track, to find the number of yards that are covered by 36\\\\r\\\\nof its paces. This is, of course, identical with the number of inches in\\\\r\\\\none of its paces.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConvenient Equivalents.--The rate of 1 mile per hour, is the equivalent\\\\r\\\\nto each of the rates in the following list:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n   Yards.      Feet.       Inches.\\\\r\\\\n   29.333, or  88.000, or  1056.000, in one minute\\\\r\\\\n or 0.488, or   1.466, or    17.600, in one second\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeasurement of Length.--Actual measurement with the rudest makeshift, is\\\\r\\\\nfar preferable to an unassisted guess, especially to an unpractised eye.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNatural Units of Length.--A man should ascertain his height; height of\\\\r\\\\nhis eye above ground; ditto, when kneeling: his fathom; his cubit; his\\\\r\\\\naverage pace; the span, from ball of thumb to tip of one of his fingers;\\\\r\\\\nthe length of the foot; the width of two, three, or four fingers; and the\\\\r\\\\ndistance between his eyes. In all probability, some one of these is an\\\\r\\\\neven and a useful number of feet or inches, which he will always be able\\\\r\\\\nto recollect, and refer to as a unit of measurement. The distance between\\\\r\\\\nthe eyes is instantly determined, and, I believe, never varies, while\\\\r\\\\nmeasurements of stature, and certainly those of girth of limb, become\\\\r\\\\nvery different when a man is exhausted by long travel and bad diet. It is\\\\r\\\\ntherefore particularly useful for measuring small objects. To find it,\\\\r\\\\nhold a stick at arm's-length, at right angles to the line of sight; then,\\\\r\\\\nlooking past its end to a distant object, shut first one eye and then the\\\\r\\\\nother, until you have satisfied yourself of the exact point on the stick\\\\r\\\\nthat covers the distant object as seen by the one eye, when the end of\\\\r\\\\nthe stick exactly covers the same object, as seen by the other eye. A\\\\r\\\\nstone's throw is a good standard of reference for greater distances.\\\\r\\\\nCricketers estimate distance by the length between wickets. Pacing yards\\\\r\\\\nshould be practised. It is well to dot or burn with the lens of your\\\\r\\\\nopera-glass a scale of inches on the gun-stock and pocket-knife.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVelocity of Sound.--Sound flies at 380 yards or about 1000 feet in a\\\\r\\\\nsecond, speaking in round numbers: it is easy to measure rough distances\\\\r\\\\nby the flash of a gun and its report; for even a storm of wind only makes\\\\r\\\\n4 per cent. difference, one way or the other, in the velocity of sound.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeasurement of Angles.--Rude Measurements.--I find that a capital\\\\r\\\\nsubstitute for a very rude sextant is afforded by the outstretched hand\\\\r\\\\nand arm. The span between the middle finger and the thumb subtends an\\\\r\\\\nangle of about 15 degrees, and that between the forefinger and the thumb\\\\r\\\\nan angle of 11 1/4 degrees, or one point of the compass. Just as a person\\\\r\\\\nmay learn to walk yards accurately, so may he learn to span out these\\\\r\\\\nangular distances accurately; and the horizon, however broken it may be,\\\\r\\\\nis always before his eyes to check him. Thus, if he begins from a tree,\\\\r\\\\nor even from a book on his shelves and spans all round until he comes to\\\\r\\\\nthe tree or book again, he should make twenty-four of the larger spans\\\\r\\\\nand thirty-two of the lesser ones. These two angles of 15 degrees and 11\\\\r\\\\n1/4 degrees are particularly important. The sun travels through 15\\\\r\\\\ndegrees in each hour; and therefore, by \\\\\\\"spanning\\\\\\\" along its course, as\\\\r\\\\nestimated, from the place where it would stand at noon (aided in this by\\\\r\\\\nthe compass), the hour before or after noon, and, similarly after sunrise\\\\r\\\\nor before sunset, can be instantly reckoned. Again, the angles 30\\\\r\\\\ndegrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, all of them simple\\\\r\\\\nmultiples of 15 degrees, are by far the most useful ones in taking rough\\\\r\\\\nmeasurements of heights and distances, because of the simple relations\\\\r\\\\nbetween the sides of right-angled triangles, one of whose other angles\\\\r\\\\nare 30 degrees, 45 degrees, or 60 degrees; and also because 60 degrees is\\\\r\\\\nthe value of an angle of an equilateral triangle. As regards 11 1/4\\\\r\\\\ndegrees, or one point of the compass, it is perfectly out of the question\\\\r\\\\nto trust to bearings taken by the unaided eye, or to steer a steady\\\\r\\\\ncourse by simply watching a star or landmark, when this happens to be\\\\r\\\\nmuch to the right or the left of it. Now, nothing is easier than to span\\\\r\\\\nout the bearing from time to time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRight-angles to lay out.--A triangle whose sides are as 3, 4, and 5, must\\\\r\\\\nbe a right-angled one, since 5 x 5 = 3 x 3 + 4 x 4; therefore we can find\\\\r\\\\na right-angle very simply by means of a measuring-tape. We take a length\\\\r\\\\nof twelve feet, yards, fathoms, or whatever it may be, and peg its two\\\\r\\\\nends, side by side, to the ground. Peg No. 2 is driven in at the third\\\\r\\\\ndivision, and peg No. 3 is held at the seventh division of the cord,\\\\r\\\\nwhich is stretched out till it becomes taut; then the peg is driven in.\\\\r\\\\nThese three pegs will form the corners of a right-angled triangle; peg\\\\r\\\\nNo. 2 being situated at the right-angle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProximate Arcs.--\\\\r\\\\n1 degree subtends, at a distance of 1 statute mile, 90 feet.\\\\r\\\\n1' subtends, at a distance of 1 statute mile, 18 inches.\\\\r\\\\n1' subtends at a distance of 100 yards, 1 inch.\\\\r\\\\n1\\\\\\\" of latitude on the earth's surface is 100 feet.\\\\r\\\\n30' is subtended by the diameter of either the sun or the moon.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAngles measured by their Chords.--The number of degrees contained by any\\\\r\\\\ngiven angle, may be ascertained without a protractor or other angular\\\\r\\\\ninstrument, by means of a Table of Chords. So, also, may any required\\\\r\\\\nangle be protracted on paper, through the same simple means. In the first\\\\r\\\\ninstance, draw a circle on paper with its centre at the apex of the angle\\\\r\\\\nand with a radius of 1000, next measure the distance between the points\\\\r\\\\nwhere the circle is cut by the two lines that enclose the angle. Lastly\\\\r\\\\nlook for that distance (which is the chord of the angle) in the annexed\\\\r\\\\ntable, where the corresponding number of degrees will be found, where the\\\\r\\\\ncorresponding number of degrees will be found. If it be desired to\\\\r\\\\nprotract a given angle, the same operation is to be performed in a\\\\r\\\\nconverse sense. I need hardly mention that the chord of an angle is the\\\\r\\\\nsame thing as twice the sine of half that angle; but as tables of natural\\\\r\\\\nsines are not now-a-days commonly to be met with, I have thought it well\\\\r\\\\nworth while to give a Table of Chords. When a traveller, who is\\\\r\\\\nunprovided with regular instruments, wishes to triangulate, or when\\\\r\\\\nhaving taken some bearings but having no protractor, he wishes to lay\\\\r\\\\nthem down upon his map, this little table will prove of very great\\\\r\\\\nservice to him. (See \\\\\\\"Measurement of distances to inaccessible places.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Table of Chords to Radius of 1000].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTriangulation.--Measurement of distance to an inaccessible place.--By\\\\r\\\\nsimilar triangles.--To show how the breadth of a river may be measured\\\\r\\\\nwithout instruments, without any table, and without crossing it, I have\\\\r\\\\ntaken the following useful problem from the French 'Manuel du Genie.'\\\\r\\\\nThose usually given by English writers for the same purpose are,\\\\r\\\\nstrangely enough, unsatisfactory, for they require the measurement of an\\\\r\\\\nangle. This plan requires pacing only. To measure A G, produce it for any\\\\r\\\\ndistance, as to D; from D, in any convenient direction, take any equal\\\\r\\\\ndistances, D C, c d; produce B C to b, making c B--C B; join d b, and\\\\r\\\\nproduce it to a, that is to say, to the point where A C produced\\\\r\\\\nintersects it; then the triangles to the left of C, are similar to those\\\\r\\\\non the right of C, and therefore a b is equal to A B. The points D C,\\\\r\\\\netc., may be marked by bushes planted in the ground, or by men standing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe disadvantages of this plan are its complexity, and the usual\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty of finding a sufficient space of level ground, for its\\\\r\\\\nexecution. The method given in the following paragraph is incomparably\\\\r\\\\nmore facile and generally applicable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTriangulation by measurement of Chords.--Colonel Everest, the late\\\\r\\\\nSurveyor-General of India, pointed out (Journ. Roy. Geograph. Soc. 1860,\\\\r\\\\np. 122) the advantage to travellers, unprovided with angular instruments,\\\\r\\\\nof measure the chords of the angles they wish to determine. He showed\\\\r\\\\nthat a person who desired to make a rude measurement of the angle C A B,\\\\r\\\\nin the figure (p. 40), has simply to pace for any convenient length from\\\\r\\\\nA towards C, reaching, we will say, the point a' and then to pace an\\\\r\\\\nequal distance from A towards B, reaching the point a ae. Then it remains\\\\r\\\\nfor him to pace the distance a' a\\\\\\\" which is the chord of the angle A to\\\\r\\\\nthe radius A a'. Knowing this, he can ascertain the value of the angle C\\\\r\\\\nA B by reference to a proper table. In the same way the angle C B A can\\\\r\\\\nbe ascertained. Lastly, by pacing the distance A B, to serve as a base,\\\\r\\\\nall the necessary data will have been obtained for determining the lines\\\\r\\\\nA C and B C. The problem can be worked out, either by calculation or by\\\\r\\\\nprotraction. I have made numerous measurements in this way, and find the\\\\r\\\\npractical error to be within five per cent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTable for rude triangulation by Chords.--It occurred to me that the plan\\\\r\\\\ndescribed in the foregoing paragraph might be exceedingly simplified by a\\\\r\\\\ntable, such as that which I annex in which different values of a' a\\\\\\\" are\\\\r\\\\ngiven for a radius of 10, and in which the calculations are made for a\\\\r\\\\nbase = 100. The units in which A a', A a\\\\\\\", and B b', Bb\\\\\\\", are to be\\\\r\\\\nmeasured are intended to be paces, though, of course, any other units\\\\r\\\\nwould do. The units in which the base is measured may be feet, yards,\\\\r\\\\nminutes, or hours' journey, or whatever else is convenient. Any multiple\\\\r\\\\nor divisor of 100 may be used for the base, if the tabular number be\\\\r\\\\nsimilarly multiplied. Therefore a traveller may ascertain the breadth of\\\\r\\\\na river, or that of a valley, or the distance of any object on either\\\\r\\\\nside of his line of march, by taking not more than some sixty additional\\\\r\\\\npaces, and by making a single reference to my table. Particular care must\\\\r\\\\nbe taken to walk in a straight line from A to B, by sighting some more\\\\r\\\\ndistant object in a line with B. It will otherwise surprise most people,\\\\r\\\\non looking back at their track, to see how curved it has been and how far\\\\r\\\\ntheir b' B is from being in the right direction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Contains Table for Rough Triangulation without the usual instruments,\\\\r\\\\nand without Calculation\\\\\\\"].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeasurement of Time.--Sun Dial.--Plant a stake firmly in the ground in a\\\\r\\\\nlevel open space, and get ready a piece of string, a tent-peg, and a bit\\\\r\\\\nof stick a foot long. When the stars begin to appear, and before it is\\\\r\\\\ndark, go to the stake, lie down on the ground, and plant the stick, so\\\\r\\\\nadjusting it that its top and the point where the string is tied to the\\\\r\\\\nstake shall be in a line with the Polar Star, or rather with the Pole\\\\r\\\\n(see below); then get up, stretch the string so as just to touch the top\\\\r\\\\nof the stick, and stake it down with the tent-peg. Kneel down again, to\\\\r\\\\nsee that all is right, and in the morning draw out the dial-lines; the\\\\r\\\\nstring being the gnomon. The true North Pole is distant about 1 1/2\\\\r\\\\ndegree, or three suns' (or moons') diameters from the Polar Star, and it\\\\r\\\\nlies between the Polar Star and the pointers of the Great Bear, or, more\\\\r\\\\ntruly, between it and [Greek letter] Urs ae Majoris.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Small drawing illustrating these directions in above text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe one essential point of dial-making is to set the gnomon truly,\\\\r\\\\nbecause it ensures that the shadows shall fall in the same direction at\\\\r\\\\nthe same hours all the year round. To ascertain where to mark the\\\\r\\\\nhour-lines on the ground, or wall, on which the shadow of the gnomon\\\\r\\\\nfalls, the simplest plan is to use a watch, or whatever makeshift means\\\\r\\\\nof reckoning time be at hand. Calculations are troublesome, unless the\\\\r\\\\nplate is quite level, or vertical, and exactly facing south or north, or\\\\r\\\\nelse in the plane of the Equinox.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe figure represents the well-known equinoctial sun-dial. It can easily\\\\r\\\\nbe cast in lead. The spike points towards the elevated pole, and the rim\\\\r\\\\nof the disc is divided into 24 equal parts for the hours.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPendulum.--A Traveller, when the last of his watches breaks down, has no\\\\r\\\\nneed to be disheartened from going on with his longitudinal observations,\\\\r\\\\nespecially if he observes occulations and eclipses. The object of a watch\\\\r\\\\nis to tell the number of seconds that elapse between the instant of\\\\r\\\\nocculation, eclipse, etc., and the instant, a minute or two later, when\\\\r\\\\nthe sextant observation for time is made. All that a watch actually does\\\\r\\\\nis to beat seconds, and to record the number of beats. Now, a string and\\\\r\\\\nstone, swung as a pendulum, will beat time; and a native who is taught to\\\\r\\\\nthrow a pebble into a bag at each beat, will record it; and, for\\\\r\\\\noperations that do not occupy much time, he will be as good as a watch.\\\\r\\\\nThe rate of the pendulum may be determined by taking two sets of\\\\r\\\\nobservations, with three or four minutes' interval between them; and, if\\\\r\\\\nthe distance from the point of suspension to the centre of the stone be\\\\r\\\\nthirty-nine inches, and if the string be thin and the stone very heavy,\\\\r\\\\nit will beat seconds very nearly indeed. The observations upon which the\\\\r\\\\nlongitude of the East African lakes depended, after Captain Speke's first\\\\r\\\\njourney to them, were lunars, timed with a string and a stone, in default\\\\r\\\\nof a watch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHour-glass.--Either dry sand or water may be used in an hour-glass; if\\\\r\\\\nwater be used, the aperture through which it runs must, of course, be\\\\r\\\\nsmaller.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCLIMBING AND MOUNTAINEERING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nClimbing.--Climbing trees.--Colonel Jackson, in his book, 'How to\\\\r\\\\nObserve,' gives the following directions for climbing palms and other\\\\r\\\\ntrees that have very rough barks:--\\\\\\\"Take a strip of linen, or two towels\\\\r\\\\nor strong handkerchiefs tied together, and form a loop at each end, for\\\\r\\\\nthe feet to pass tightly into without going through; or, for want of such\\\\r\\\\nmaterial, make a rope of grass or straw in the same way. The length\\\\r\\\\nshould embrace a little more than half of the diameter of the trunk to be\\\\r\\\\nclimbed. Now, being at the foot of the tree, fix the feet well into the\\\\r\\\\nloops, and opening the legs a little, embrace the tree as high up as you\\\\r\\\\ncan. Raise your legs, and pressing the cord against the tree with your\\\\r\\\\nfeet, stand, as it were, in your stirrups, and raise your body and arms\\\\r\\\\nhigher; hold fast again by the arms, open the legs, and raise them a\\\\r\\\\nstage higher, and so on to the top. The descent is effected in the same\\\\r\\\\nway, reversing, of course, the order of the movements. The ruggedness of\\\\r\\\\nthe bark, and the weight of the body pressing diagonally across the trunk\\\\r\\\\nof the tree, prevent the rope from slipping. Anything, provided it be\\\\r\\\\nstrong enough, is better than a round rope, which does not hold so fast.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nA loop or hoop embracing the body of the climber and the tree, is a\\\\r\\\\nhelpful addition. Large nails carried in a bag slung round the waist, to\\\\r\\\\nbe driven into the bare trunk of the tree, will facilitate its ascent.\\\\r\\\\nGimlets may be used for the same purpose. High walls can be climbed by\\\\r\\\\nhelp of this description; a weight attached to one end of a rope, being\\\\r\\\\nfirst thrown over the wall, and the climber assisting himself by holding\\\\r\\\\non to the other end. Trees of soft wood are climbed by cutting notches\\\\r\\\\ntwo feet apart on alternate sides. Also by driving in bamboo pegs,\\\\r\\\\nsloping alternately to left or to right; these pegs correspond to the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"rungs\\\\\\\" of a ladder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLadders.--A notched pole or a knotted rope makes a ladder. We hear of\\\\r\\\\npeople who have tied sheets together to let themselves down high walls,\\\\r\\\\nwhen making an escape. The best way of making a long rope from sheets, is\\\\r\\\\nto cut them into strips of about six inches broad, and with these to\\\\r\\\\ntwist a two-stranded rope, or else to plait a three-stranded one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDescending cliffs with ropes is an art which naturalists and others have\\\\r\\\\noccasion to practise. It has been reduced to a system by the inhabitants\\\\r\\\\nof some rocky coasts in the Northern seas, where innumerable sea-birds go\\\\r\\\\nfor the breeding season, and whose ledges and crevices are crammed with\\\\r\\\\nnests full of large eggs, about the end of May and the beginning of June.\\\\r\\\\nThey are no despicable prize to a hungry native. I am indebted to a most\\\\r\\\\ndevoted rock-climber, the late Mr. Woolley, for the following facts. It\\\\r\\\\nappears that the whole population are rock-climbers, in the following\\\\r\\\\nplaces:--St. Kilda, in the Hebrides; Foula Island, in Shetland; the Faroe\\\\r\\\\nIslands generally; and in the Westmarver Islands off Iceland. Flamborough\\\\r\\\\nHead used to be a famous place for this accomplishment, but the birds\\\\r\\\\nhave become far less numerous; they have been destroyed very wantonly\\\\r\\\\nwith shot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn descending a cliff, two ropes are used; one a supply well-made,\\\\r\\\\nmany-stranded, inch rope (see \\\\\\\"Ropes\\\\\\\"), to which the climber is attached,\\\\r\\\\nand by which he is let down; the other is a much thinner cord, left to\\\\r\\\\ndangle over the cliff, and made fast to some stone or stake above. The\\\\r\\\\nuse of the second rope is for the climber to haul upon, when he wishes to\\\\r\\\\nbe pulled up. By resting a large part of his weight upon it, he makes the\\\\r\\\\ntask of pulling him up much more easy. He can also convey signals by\\\\r\\\\njerking it. A usual rock-climbing arrangement is shown in the sketch. One\\\\r\\\\nman with a post behind him, as in fig. 1, or two men, as in fig. 2 are\\\\r\\\\nentrusted with the letting down of a comrade to the depth of 100 or even\\\\r\\\\n150 feet. They pass the rope either under their thighs or along their\\\\r\\\\nsides, as shown in the figures. The climber is attached to the rope, as\\\\r\\\\nshown in fig. 2. The band on which he sits is of worsted. A beginner\\\\r\\\\nought to be attached far more securely to the rope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig 2 appear on p 45].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(I have tried several plans, and find that which is shown in Fig. 1 to be\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly comfortable and secure. A stick forms the seat' at either end\\\\r\\\\nof it is a short stirrup; garters secure the stirrup leathers to the\\\\r\\\\nknees; there is a belt under the arms.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is convenient, but not necessary, to have a well-greased leather\\\\r\\\\nsheath, a tube of eighteen inches in length, through which the rope runs,\\\\r\\\\nas shown in both figures. It lies over the edges of the cliff, and the\\\\r\\\\nfriction of the rock keeps it steadily in its place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is nervous work going over the edge of a cliff for the first time;\\\\r\\\\nhowever, the sensation does not include giddiness. Once in the air, and\\\\r\\\\nwhen confidence is acquired, the occupation is very exhilarating. The\\\\r\\\\npower of locomotion is marvellous: a slight push with the foot, or a\\\\r\\\\nthrust with a stick, will swing the climber twenty feet to a side. Few\\\\r\\\\nrocks are so precipitous but that a climber can generally make some use\\\\r\\\\nof his hands and feet; enough to cling to the rock when he wishes, and to\\\\r\\\\nclamber about its face. The wind is seldom a gale above, but the air will\\\\r\\\\nbe comparatively quiet upon the face; and therefore there is no danger of\\\\r\\\\na chance gush dashing the climber against the rocks. A short stick is\\\\r\\\\nuseful, but not necessary. There are three cautions to be borne in mind.\\\\r\\\\n1. As you go down, test every stone carefully. If the movement of the\\\\r\\\\nrope displaces any one of them, after you have been let down below it, it\\\\r\\\\nis nearly sure to fall upon your head, because you will be vertically\\\\r\\\\nbeneath it. Some climbers use a kind of helmet as a shield against these\\\\r\\\\nvery dangerous accidents. 2. Take care that the rope does not become\\\\r\\\\njammed in a cleft, or you will be helplessly suspended in mid-air. Keep\\\\r\\\\nthe rope pretty tight when you are clambering about the ledges: else, if\\\\r\\\\nyou slip, the jerk may break the rope, or cause an overpowering strain\\\\r\\\\nupon the men who are holding it above.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTurf and solid rock are much the best substances for the rope to run\\\\r\\\\nover. In the Faroes, they tar the ropes excessively; they are absolutely\\\\r\\\\npolished with tar. Good ropes are highly valued. In St. Kilda, leather\\\\r\\\\nropes are used: they last a lifetime, and are a dowry for a daughter. A\\\\r\\\\nnew rope spins terribly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLeaping Poles.--In France they practise a way of crossing a deep brook by\\\\r\\\\nthe help of a rope passed round an overhanging branch of a tree growing\\\\r\\\\nby its side. They take a run and swing themselves across, pendulum\\\\r\\\\nfashion. It is the principle of the leaping-pole, reversed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe art of climbing difficult places.--Always face difficult places; if\\\\r\\\\nyou slip, let your first effort be to turn upon your stomach, for in\\\\r\\\\nevery other position you are helpless. A mountaineer, when he meets with\\\\r\\\\na formidable obstacle, does not hold on the rock by means of his feet and\\\\r\\\\nhis hands only, but he clings to it like a caterpillar, with every part\\\\r\\\\nof his body that can come simultaneously into contact with its roughened\\\\r\\\\nsurface.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow Mountains.--Precautions.--The real dangers of the high Alps may be\\\\r\\\\nreduced to three:--1. Yielding of snow-bridges over crevices. 2. Slipping\\\\r\\\\non slopes of ice. 3. The fall of ice, or rocks, from above. Absolute\\\\r\\\\nsecurity from the first is obtainable by tying the party together at\\\\r\\\\nintervals to a rope. If there be only two in company, they should be tied\\\\r\\\\ntogether at eight or ten paces apart. Against the second danger, the rope\\\\r\\\\nis usually effective, though frightful accidents have occurred by the\\\\r\\\\nfall of one man, dragging along with him the whole chain of his\\\\r\\\\ncompanions. Against the third danger there is no resource but\\\\r\\\\ncircumspection. Ice falls chiefly in the heat of the day; it is from\\\\r\\\\nlimestone cliffs that the falling rocks are nearly always detached. When\\\\r\\\\nclimbing ice of the most moderate slope, nailed boots are an absolute\\\\r\\\\nnecessity; and for steep slopes of ice, the ice-axe (described below) is\\\\r\\\\nequally essential.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlpine Outfit consists of ropes, ice-axe or alpenstock (there must be at\\\\r\\\\nleast one ice-axe in the party), nailed boots, coloured spectacles, veil\\\\r\\\\nor else a linen mask, muffettees, and gaiters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI give the following extracts from the Report of a Committee appointed by\\\\r\\\\nthe Alpine Club in 1864, on Ropes, Axes, and Alpenstocks:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRopes.--We have endeavoured to ascertain what ropes will best stand the\\\\r\\\\nsharp jerk which would be caused by a man falling suddenly into a\\\\r\\\\ncrevasse, or down an ice-slope: and on this subject we lay before the\\\\r\\\\nClub the result of nearly a hundred experiments, made with various kinds\\\\r\\\\nof rope purchased of the best London makers. We considered that the least\\\\r\\\\nweight with which it was practically useful to test ropes, was twelve\\\\r\\\\nstone, as representing the average weight of a light man with his whole\\\\r\\\\nAlpine equipment. In the preliminary experiments, therefore, all ropes\\\\r\\\\nwere rejected which did not support the strain produced by twelve stone\\\\r\\\\nfalling five feet. Under this trial, all those plaited ropes which are\\\\r\\\\ngenerally supposed to be so strong, and many most carefully-made twisted\\\\r\\\\nropes, gave way in such a manner as was very startling to some of our\\\\r\\\\nnumber, who had been in the habit of using these treacherous cords with\\\\r\\\\nperfect and most unfounded confidence. Only four ropes passed\\\\r\\\\nsuccessfully through this trial; these were all made by Messrs.\\\\r\\\\nBuckingham and Sons, of 33, Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and can be procured\\\\r\\\\nonly of them. We confined our further experiments to these ropes, one of\\\\r\\\\nwhich failed under severer tests, while the remaining three, made\\\\r\\\\nrespectively of Manilla hemp, Italian hemp, and flax, proved so nearly\\\\r\\\\nequal in strength that it may fairly be doubted which is on the whole to\\\\r\\\\nbe preferred. Each of these three ropes will bear twelve stone falling\\\\r\\\\nten feet, and fourteen stone falling eight feet; and it may be useful to\\\\r\\\\nsay that the strain upon a rope loaded with a weight of fourteen stone,\\\\r\\\\nand suddenly checked after a fall of eight feet, is nearly equal to that\\\\r\\\\nwhich is caused by a dead weight of two tons. None of these ropes,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, will bear a weight of fourteen stone falling ten feet; and the\\\\r\\\\nresult of our experiments is, that no rope can be made, whether of hemp,\\\\r\\\\nflax, or silk, which is strong enough to bear that strain, and yet light\\\\r\\\\nenough to be portable. We believe that these ropes, which weigh about\\\\r\\\\nthree-quarters of an ounce to the foot, are the heaviest which can be\\\\r\\\\nconveniently carried about in the Alps. We append a statement of the\\\\r\\\\nrespective merits of the three kinds, all of which are now made by\\\\r\\\\nMessrs. Buckingham, expressly for the Club, and marked by a red worsted\\\\r\\\\nthread twisted in the strands:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 1. MANILLA HEMP. Weight of 20 yards, 48 oz. Advantages--Is softer and\\\\r\\\\nmore pliable than 2. Is more elastic than 2 and 3. When wet, is far more\\\\r\\\\npleasant to handle than 2 and 3. Disadvantages--Has a tendency to wear\\\\r\\\\nand fray at a knot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 2. ITALIAN HEMP. Weight of 20 yards, 43 oz. Advantages--Is less bulky\\\\r\\\\nthan 1 and 3. Is harder, and will probably wear best, being least likely\\\\r\\\\nto cut against rocks. Disadvantages--Is much more still and difficult to\\\\r\\\\nuntie than 1 and 3. When wet, is very disagreeable to handle, and is apt\\\\r\\\\nto kink.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo. 3. FLAX. Weight of 20 yards, 44 oz. Advantages--When dry, is softer,\\\\r\\\\nmore pliable, and easier to handle than 1 and 2, and will probably wear\\\\r\\\\nbetter than 1. Disadvantages--When wet, becomes decidedly somewhat\\\\r\\\\nweaker, and is nearly as disagreeable to handle as 2.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKnots.--There can be no doubt that every knot in a rope weakens its power\\\\r\\\\nof resisting a sudden jerking strain. How great a loss of strength\\\\r\\\\nresults from a knot we cannot undertake to estimate, but that the loss is\\\\r\\\\na very serious one the following statement will show: these ropes which\\\\r\\\\nwe report will resist the strain of fourteen stone falling eight feet,\\\\r\\\\nwill not resist it if there is a knot in any one of them; or even if the\\\\r\\\\nknots used in attaching them to the point of support, or to the weights,\\\\r\\\\nbe roughly or carelessly made. The rope in these cases breaks at the\\\\r\\\\nknot, for two reasons; partly because of the folds, as they cross in the\\\\r\\\\nknot, are strained suddenly across each other, and one of them is cut\\\\r\\\\nthrough; and partly because the rope is so sharply bent that the outer\\\\r\\\\nside of each fold in the knot is much more stretched than the inner side,\\\\r\\\\nso that the strain comes almost entirely upon one side only of each fold.\\\\r\\\\nFor the first reason, we found it necessary to put a pad of some kind\\\\r\\\\ninside the knot--leather, linen, or a little tow or waste rope will do.\\\\r\\\\nFor the second reason we preferred knots in which the folds are least\\\\r\\\\nsharply bent round each other; that is, in which the curves are large. We\\\\r\\\\ntherefore conclude that--1st. No knot, which is not absolutely necessary,\\\\r\\\\nought to be allowed to remain on the rope: 2nd. The tighter and harder a\\\\r\\\\nknot becomes, the worse it is: 3rd. The more loose and open a knot is\\\\r\\\\nmade, the better it is:--and we append diagrams of those knots which we\\\\r\\\\nfound by experiment weaken the rope least. For Alpine ropes, only three\\\\r\\\\nsorts of knots are ever required, and we suggest one of each kind:--No. 1\\\\r\\\\nis for the purpose of joining two ends. No. 2 is for the purpose of\\\\r\\\\nmaking a loop at one end. No. 3 is for the purpose of making a loop in\\\\r\\\\nthe middle when the ends are fastened. No. 4 is a knot, of which we give\\\\r\\\\na diagram in order that no one may imitate it. It is one of those which\\\\r\\\\nmost weaken the rope. The only one which seemed to be equally injurious\\\\r\\\\nis the common single knot, of which no diagram is necessary. As the topes\\\\r\\\\nwhich we have recommended are very liable to become untwisted, unless the\\\\r\\\\nloose ends are secured, we advise travellers, in order to avoid knots, to\\\\r\\\\nhave the ends of every piece of rope bound with waxed twine. It should\\\\r\\\\nalso be known that it is very unsafe to join two pieces of rope by\\\\r\\\\nlooping one end through the other, so that when the jerk comes, they will\\\\r\\\\nbe strained across each other as two links of a chain are strained across\\\\r\\\\neach other. Unless a pad of some kind divides the loops, one will cut the\\\\r\\\\nother through.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Four diagrams of knots on this page].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAxes.--The axes made in England for the purpose of being taken out to\\\\r\\\\nSwitzerland, may be divided into two classes, namely: travellers' axes,\\\\r\\\\nintended to be used for chipping a few occasional steps, for enlarging\\\\r\\\\nand clearing out those imperfectly made, and for holding on to a\\\\r\\\\nsnow-slope,--and guides' axes, which are the heavier implements required\\\\r\\\\nfor making long staircases in hard blue ice. We have had three models\\\\r\\\\nprepared, of which diagrams are appended; the first two represent the\\\\r\\\\nlighter axe, or what we have termed the travellers' axe; and the third,\\\\r\\\\nthe heavier instrument required for guides' work. Diagram No. 1\\\\r\\\\nrepresents a light axe or pick, of a kind somewhat similar to that\\\\r\\\\nrecommended by Mr. Stephen, in a paper published a short time ago in the\\\\r\\\\n'Journal.' It has, in the first place, the great advantage of lightness\\\\r\\\\nand handiness, while its single blade, to some extent, combines the\\\\r\\\\nstep-cutting qualities possessed by the two cutters of the ordinary\\\\r\\\\ndouble-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly\\\\r\\\\nsuperior. The small hammer-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on\\\\r\\\\nthe whole decidedly superior. The small hammer-head at the back is added\\\\r\\\\nin order to balance the pick, and in some degree to improve the hold when\\\\r\\\\nthe axe-head comes to be used as a crutch handle. This form, it should be\\\\r\\\\nunderstood, we recommend on account of its lightness and of its\\\\r\\\\nconvenient shape. Diagram No. 2 represents a travellers' axe, slightly\\\\r\\\\nheavier than the first; and as this is the shape which appears to us the\\\\r\\\\nbest adapted for mountain work of all kinds, we desire shortly to state\\\\r\\\\nour reasons for recommending it to members of the Club.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig 2, shapes of axes, are on this page.].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the first place it is absolutely necessary that one of the cutters\\\\r\\\\nshould be made in the form of a pick, as this is by far the best\\\\r\\\\ninstrument for hacking into hard ice, and is also extremely convenient\\\\r\\\\nfor holding on to a snow-slope, or hooking into crannies, or on to ledges\\\\r\\\\nof rock.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor the other cutter we recommend an adze-shaped blade, and we are\\\\r\\\\nconvinced that this is the form which will be found most generally\\\\r\\\\nuseful, as being best suited for all the varieties of step-cutting. The\\\\r\\\\nhatchet-shaped blade used by the Chamouni guides is no doubt a better\\\\r\\\\nimplement for making a staircase diagonally up a slope, but on the other\\\\r\\\\nhand it is exceedingly difficult to cut steps downwards with a blade set\\\\r\\\\non in this manner; and as mountaineers rarely come down the way by which\\\\r\\\\nthey went up, if they can help it, it is obvious that this objection to\\\\r\\\\nthe Chamouni form of axe is conclusive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe recommend that the edge of the blade should be angular instead of\\\\r\\\\ncircular, although the latter shape is more common, because it is clear\\\\r\\\\nthat the angular edge cuts into frozen snow more quickly and easily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe curve, which is the same in all the axes, approaches to coincidence\\\\r\\\\nwith the curve described by the axe in making the stroke. A curve is, in\\\\r\\\\nour opinion, desirable, in order to bring the point more nearly opposite\\\\r\\\\nthe centre of percussion, and to make the head more useful for holding on\\\\r\\\\nto rocks or a slope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe axe shown in diagram No. 2, though slightly heavier than No. 1, is\\\\r\\\\nnot of sufficient weight or strength for cutting a series of steps in\\\\r\\\\nhard ice. To those gentlemen, therefore, who do not object to carrying\\\\r\\\\nweight, but who desire to have an axe fit for any kind of work, we\\\\r\\\\nrecommend No. 3. As this is exactly similar in shape to No. 2, differing\\\\r\\\\nfrom it only in size, we have not thought it necessary to give a separate\\\\r\\\\ndiagram of No. 3.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs to the mode of fastening, which is the same in all three axes, we\\\\r\\\\nshould have felt some diffidence in giving an opinion had we not been\\\\r\\\\nfortunate enough to obtain the advice of an experienced metal-worker, by\\\\r\\\\nwhom we were strongly recommended to adopt the fastening shown in the\\\\r\\\\ndiagrams, as being the method generally considered best in the trade for\\\\r\\\\nattaching the heads of hatchets, or large hammers likely to be subjected\\\\r\\\\nto very violent strains. It will be seen that the axe-head and fastening\\\\r\\\\nare forged in one solid piece, the fastening consisting of two strong\\\\r\\\\nbraces or straps of steel, which are pressed into the wood about\\\\r\\\\none-eighth of an inch, and are secured by two rivets, passed through the\\\\r\\\\nwood and clenched on each side. The braces are put at the side, instead\\\\r\\\\nof in front of and behind the axe, because by this means, the strain\\\\r\\\\nwhich falls on the axe acts against the whole breadth of the steel\\\\r\\\\nfastenings, and not against their thickness merely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe believe that this is the firmest method of fastening which can be\\\\r\\\\nadopted, and that so long as the wood is sound, it is scarcely possible\\\\r\\\\nfor the head of the axe to get loose or to come off; and it has the\\\\r\\\\nfurther advantage of strengthening the wood instead of weakening it, and\\\\r\\\\nof distributing the strain produced by step-cutting over a large bearing.\\\\r\\\\nIt should be added that these axe-heads and fastenings ought to be made\\\\r\\\\nentirely of steel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe dimensions of the axe-heads are as follow: --\\\\r\\\\nNo. 1. -- Length of blade measured from the wood.. 4 1/2 inches.\\\\r\\\\n           Breadth of blade at widest part..........1 1/2   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Weight, including the braces............13 1/2 oz.\\\\r\\\\nNo. 2. -- Length of blade measured from the wood.. 3 1/2 inches.\\\\r\\\\n           Length of pick.......................... 4 1/2   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Breadth of blade at widest part......... 1 3/4   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Breadth of pick......................... 0 1/2   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Weight, including the braces............15 1/2 oz.\\\\r\\\\nNo. 3. -- Length of blade measured from the wood.. 4     inches.\\\\r\\\\n           Length of pick.......................... 5       \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Breadth of blade at widest part......... 2 1/4   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Breadth of pick......................... 0 5/8   \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n           Weight, including the brades............21 1/4 oz.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe much desired to recommend to the Club some means by which the axe-head\\\\r\\\\nmight be made moveable, so as to be capable of being put on and taken off\\\\r\\\\nthe handle quickly and easily. We regret to say, however, that we were\\\\r\\\\nunable to discover any plan by which this can be effectually done. We\\\\r\\\\nexamined very carefully the numerous and formidable weapons which have\\\\r\\\\nbeen sent in by members for exhibition, most of which had elaborate\\\\r\\\\ncontrivances for fastening on the axe-head. These were all, however,\\\\r\\\\nliable to very serious objections. Some were evidently insecure; with\\\\r\\\\nothers it was necessary that the axe-head should be surmounted by a huge\\\\r\\\\nknob, which would prove a most serious impediment in step-cutting; while\\\\r\\\\nin the best and firmest which we found, the axe-head was attached to the\\\\r\\\\npole by means of nuts and screws projecting at the side or over the top\\\\r\\\\nof the axe. This latter method of fastening seems to us awkward and\\\\r\\\\npossibly dangerous, as the nuts, from their position, are very likely to\\\\r\\\\nbecome loose or to get broken off, and cannot, except when dangerously\\\\r\\\\nloose, be fastened or unfastened without a key or wrench--a troublesome\\\\r\\\\narticle, certain to be lost on the first expedition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Handle of the Axe should, we think, be made of ash. We recommend this\\\\r\\\\nwood in preference to deal, which is lighter and nearly as strong,\\\\r\\\\nbecause in choosing a piece of ash it is easier to select with certainty\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly sound and well-seasoned wood; and in preference to hickory and\\\\r\\\\nlance-wood, which are stronger, because these woods are extremely heavy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe handle should, we believe, be of a very slightly oval form, as it is\\\\r\\\\nthen more convenient to the grasp than if round. As to the thickness of\\\\r\\\\nthe wood, we are satisfied it ought nowhere to be less than 1 3/8 inch,\\\\r\\\\nsince a pole of that diameter, made of ordinarily good ash, is the\\\\r\\\\nsmallest which cannot be permanently bent by a heavy man's most violent\\\\r\\\\neffort; although we have seen some pieces of unusually strong ash of a\\\\r\\\\nless thickness, which proved inflexible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe recommend, then, that the oval section of the handle should have a\\\\r\\\\nshorter diameter of 1 3/8 inch, and a longer diameter of 1 1/2 inch, and\\\\r\\\\nthat the thickness should be the same from one end to the other. The\\\\r\\\\nlength of the handles for Nos. 1 and 2 should be such that they will\\\\r\\\\nreach to just under the arm at the shoulder. The handle for No. 3, which\\\\r\\\\nis intended to be used exclusively as an axe, should be between 3 1/2 and\\\\r\\\\n4 feet long. The lower end of the handle should be strengthened in the\\\\r\\\\nusual way by a ferrule, and armed with a spike.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe spike should be from 3 1/2 to 4 inches long, clear of the end of the\\\\r\\\\nhandle, and should be prevented from moving by a slight rivet passed\\\\r\\\\nthrough it near the upper end after it is fastened in. The exact form of\\\\r\\\\nthe spike and ferrule are represented in the diagram.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe have further to recommend for axe-handles an addition which is liable\\\\r\\\\nto suspicion as an entire innovation, but which, we are confident, will\\\\r\\\\nbe found valuable at those critical moments when the axe is required to\\\\r\\\\nhold up two or three men. It has happened that when the axe has been\\\\r\\\\nstruck into the snow a man has been unable to keep his hold of the\\\\r\\\\nhandle, which slips out of his hand, and leaves him perfectly helpless.\\\\r\\\\nTo guard against this mischance, we propose to fasten a band of leather\\\\r\\\\nround the handle, at a distance of a foot from the ferrule at the lower\\\\r\\\\nend. This leather should be about an eighth of an inch thick, and will be\\\\r\\\\nquite sufficient to check the hand when it is sliding down the handle. It\\\\r\\\\nshould be lashed round the wood and strained tight when wet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlpenstocks.--What we have said about the handle of the axe applies in\\\\r\\\\nall respects to the Alpenstock, except that the length of the latter\\\\r\\\\nshould be different, and that the leathern ring would of course not be\\\\r\\\\nrequired. It is generally thought most convenient that the Alpenstock\\\\r\\\\nshould be high enough to touch the chin of its owner, as he stands\\\\r\\\\nupright; but this is a matter on which it is scarcely possible, and, were\\\\r\\\\nit possible, scarcely necessary to lay down an absolute rule.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoots.--Several nails are sure to be knocked out after each hard day's\\\\r\\\\nwork, therefore a reserve supply is necessary in lands where none other\\\\r\\\\nare to be found. No makeshift contrivance, so far as I am aware, will\\\\r\\\\nreplace the iron last used by shoemakers when they hammer nails into the\\\\r\\\\nboot. There is a well-known contrivance of screws with jagged heads, for\\\\r\\\\nscrewing into boots when a little ice has to be crossed. They do\\\\r\\\\nexcellently for occasional purposes, but not for regular ice-work, as\\\\r\\\\nthey are easily torn out. Crampons are soles of leather with spikes; they\\\\r\\\\nare tied over the shoes, but neither English mountaineers nor modern\\\\r\\\\nguides ever employ them: nailed boots are better.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow Spectacles.--The Esquimaux, who have no coloured glass, or any\\\\r\\\\nequivalent for it, cut a piece of soft wood to the curvature of the face;\\\\r\\\\nit is about two inches thick, and extends horizontally quite across both\\\\r\\\\neyes, resting on the nose, a notch being cut in the wood to answer the\\\\r\\\\npurpose of the bridge of a pair of spectacles. It is tied behind the\\\\r\\\\nears; and, so far as I have now described it would exclude every ray of\\\\r\\\\nlight from the eyes. Next, a long narrow slit, of the thickness of a thin\\\\r\\\\nsaw-cut, is made along the middle almost from end to end. Through this\\\\r\\\\nslit the wearer can see very fairly. As it is narrower than the diameter\\\\r\\\\nof the pupil of his eye, the light that reaches his retina is much\\\\r\\\\ndiminished in quantity. Crape or gauze is a substitute for coloured\\\\r\\\\nglass.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMask.--Is merely a pocket-handkerchief, with strings to tie it over the\\\\r\\\\nface; eye-holes are cut in it, also a hole for the nose, over which a\\\\r\\\\nprotecting triangular piece of linen is thrown, and another hole opposite\\\\r\\\\nthe mouth, to breathe through it is drawn below the chin so as to tie\\\\r\\\\nfirmly in place. The mask prevents the face from being cut to pieces by\\\\r\\\\nthe cold dry winds, and blistered by the powerful rays of the sun\\\\r\\\\nreverberated from the snow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCATTLE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHappy is the traveller who has the opportunity of hiring his cattle with\\\\r\\\\ntheir attendants: for his delay and cares are then reduced to those of\\\\r\\\\nmaking a bargain, and of riding what he has hired; and when one set of\\\\r\\\\nanimals is tired or worn out, he can leave them behind and ride on with\\\\r\\\\nothers. But, for the most part, explorers must drive their own beasts\\\\r\\\\nwith them: they must see to their being watered, tended, and run after\\\\r\\\\nwhen astray; help to pack and harness them; fatigue themselves for their\\\\r\\\\nbenefit; and drudge at the work of a cowherd for some hours a day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn fitting out a caravan, as few different kinds of animals should be\\\\r\\\\ntaken as possible, or they will split into separate herds, and require\\\\r\\\\nmany men to look after them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe dispositions of the animals that compose a caravan affect, in no\\\\r\\\\nsmall degree, the pleasure of travelling with it. Now, it is to be\\\\r\\\\nnoticed that men attach themselves to horses and asses, and in a lesser\\\\r\\\\ndegree to mules and oxen, but they rarely make friends of camels.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWeights carried by Cattle.--The net weights that these different animals\\\\r\\\\ncarry in trying, long-continued journeys--through stages uncertain in\\\\r\\\\nlength, sometimes leading to good pasture, sometimes to bad--must not be\\\\r\\\\nreckoned higher than the following; and an animal draws about 2 1/2 times\\\\r\\\\nas much net weight as he carries:--An ass, 65 lbs.; a small mule, 90\\\\r\\\\nlbs.; a horse lbs.; an ox lbs.; a camel lbs. to 200 lbs.;\\\\r\\\\nelephant lbs. In level countries--where there is grain, and where\\\\r\\\\nthe road is known and a regularity in the day's work can be ensured--the\\\\r\\\\nweights that may be carried are fully double those of the above list.\\\\r\\\\nCaptain Burton's donkeys, in East Africa, carried immense weights. Dogs\\\\r\\\\nwill draw a \\\\\\\"travail\\\\\\\" (which see) of 60 lbs. for a distance of 15 miles a\\\\r\\\\nday, upon hard level country.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTheory of Loads and Distances.--How should we load men or animals of\\\\r\\\\ntransport, and how should we urge them, in order to obtain the largest\\\\r\\\\namount of effective labour? If they carry a mere feather-weight, they may\\\\r\\\\nmake long days' journeys; but their value, as animals of transport, is\\\\r\\\\nalmost nothing. Again, on the other hand, if we load them with an\\\\r\\\\nexcessive weight, they will soon come to a standstill; and in this case,\\\\r\\\\nas in the first, their value as beasts of transport is almost nil. What\\\\r\\\\nthen, is that moderate load by which we shall obtain the largest amount\\\\r\\\\nof \\\\\\\"useful effect\\\\\\\"? this is a problem which many of the ablest engineers\\\\r\\\\nand philosophers have endeavoured to solve; and the formulae--partly\\\\r\\\\nbased on theory and partly on experiment--which were used by Euler, are\\\\r\\\\ngenerally accepted as a fair approximation. They are very simple, and\\\\r\\\\npeculiarly interesting on account of their wide applicability. They are\\\\r\\\\nequally true for men, animals, or machines; and are wholly independent of\\\\r\\\\nthe way in which the power is applied: whether, for instance, a man\\\\r\\\\ncarries his burden, or draws it, or rows or punts it in a boat, or winds\\\\r\\\\nit up with a crank or tread-mill.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTravellers might well turn the theory to account on their own behalf;\\\\r\\\\nthey are well situated for testing its truthfulness, by observing the\\\\r\\\\npractices of the countries in which they are travelling. Reliable facts\\\\r\\\\nupon the extreme distances that can be travelled over, day after day, by\\\\r\\\\npeople carrying different loads, but equally circumstanced in every other\\\\r\\\\nrespect, would be very acceptable to me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe formulae are as follow:--Let b be the burden which would just\\\\r\\\\nsuffice to prevent an animal from moving a step; d the distance he could\\\\r\\\\ntravel daily if unloaded. Also, let b1 be some burden less than b; and\\\\r\\\\nlet d1 be the distance to which he could travel daily when carrying b1.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                     Then b1 d2 = b(d-d1)2.   (1)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain, the \\\\\\\"useful effect\\\\\\\" is a maximum, if b1d1 is a maximum.  When\\\\r\\\\nthis is the case, then\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                     b1 = 4/9 b.   (2)\\\\r\\\\nAnd\\\\r\\\\n                     3 d1 = d.     (3)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn other words, an animal gets through most work in the day if he carries\\\\r\\\\n4/9 of the greatest load he could just stagger under; in which case he\\\\r\\\\nwill be able to travel 1/3 of the distance he could walk if he carried no\\\\r\\\\nload at all. (Machinery requires no repose; and therefore d, the distance\\\\r\\\\nper day, is convertible into v, the velocity of movement.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs an example:--Suppose a man is able to walk 10 miles a day, with a load\\\\r\\\\nof 130 lbs., and 33 miles a day when he carries nothing. Then, from\\\\r\\\\nequation (1), the value of b (the burden under which he would be brought\\\\r\\\\nto a standstill) would be about 267 1/2; and the best load for him, from\\\\r\\\\nequation (2), would be 119 lbs., which he would be able to carry,\\\\r\\\\naccording to equation (3), 11 miles a day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHorses.--The mode of taking wild horses is by throwing the lasso, whilst\\\\r\\\\npursuing them at full speed, and dropping a noose over their necks, by\\\\r\\\\nwhich their speed is soon checked, and they are choked down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Rarey's sixpenny book tells all that can be told on the subject of\\\\r\\\\nhorse-breaking; but far more lies in the skill and horse-knowledge of the\\\\r\\\\noperator, than in the mere theory. His way of mastering a vicious horse\\\\r\\\\nis by taking up one fore-foot, bending the knee, slipping a loop over the\\\\r\\\\nknee until it comes to the pastern-joint, and then fixing it tight. The\\\\r\\\\nloop must be caused to embrace the part between the hoof and the\\\\r\\\\npastern-joint firmly, by the help of a strap of some kind, lest it should\\\\r\\\\nslip. The horse is now on three legs, and he feels conquered. If he gets\\\\r\\\\nvery mad, wait leisurely till he becomes quiet, then caress him, and let\\\\r\\\\nthe leg down and allow him to rest; then repeat the process. If the horse\\\\r\\\\nkicks in harness, drive him slowly on three legs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn breaking-in a stubborn beast, it is convenient to physic him until he\\\\r\\\\nis sick and out of spirits, or to starve him into submission.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalt keeps horses from straying, if they are accustomed to come up to the\\\\r\\\\ncamp and get it. But it is a bad plan as they are apt to hang about,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of going off to feed. They are so fond of salt, that they have\\\\r\\\\nbeen known to stray back to a distant house where they had been allowed\\\\r\\\\nto lick it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShooting Horse.--Spur him as much as you will, but never use a whip;\\\\r\\\\nelse, whenever you raise your gun to fire, he will feel a dread that it\\\\r\\\\nmay be the whip, and will be unsteady.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHorse neighing.--Mungo Park tells how he clutched his horse's muzzle with\\\\r\\\\nboth hands to prevent his neighing, when he was in concealment and\\\\r\\\\nhorsemen were passing near.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAddenda.--In climbing a steep hill hang on to the tail of your horse as\\\\r\\\\nyou walk behind him. Horses are easily driven in file by securing the\\\\r\\\\nhalter of each horse to the tail of the one before him. To swim horses\\\\r\\\\nacross a river, to sleep by their side when there is danger, to tether\\\\r\\\\nthem, and to water them from wells, are all described elsewhere. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Horses\\\\\\\" in index.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMules.--Mules require men who know their habits; they are powerful beats,\\\\r\\\\nand can only be mastered with skill and address. A savage will not assist\\\\r\\\\nin packing them, for he fears their heels: the Swiss say mules have\\\\r\\\\nalways an arriere-pensee. They have odd secret ways, strange fancies, and\\\\r\\\\nlurking vice. When they stray, they go immense distances; and it is\\\\r\\\\nalmost beyond the power of a man on foot to tend them in a wild country:\\\\r\\\\nhe can neither overtake them easily, nor, when overtaken, catch them. The\\\\r\\\\nfemale is, in most breeds, much the more docile. They suffer from African\\\\r\\\\ndistemper, but in a less degree than horses. The following descriptions\\\\r\\\\nof mule caravans are exceedingly graphic and instructive:--\\\\\\\"The madrina\\\\r\\\\n(or godmother) is a most important personage. She is an old steady mare,\\\\r\\\\nwith a little bell round her neck, and wheresoever she goes the mules,\\\\r\\\\nlike good children, follow her. If several large troops are turned into\\\\r\\\\none field to graze in the morning, the muleteer has only to lead the\\\\r\\\\nmadrinas a little apart and tinkle their bells, and, although there may\\\\r\\\\nbe 200 or 300 mules together, each immediately knows its own bell, and\\\\r\\\\nseparates itself from the rest. The affection of these animals for their\\\\r\\\\nmadrina saves infinite trouble. It is nearly impossible to lose an old\\\\r\\\\nmule: for, if detained several hours by force, she will, by the power of\\\\r\\\\nsmell, like a dog, track out her companions, or rather the madrina; for,\\\\r\\\\naccording to the muleteer, she is the chief object of affection. The\\\\r\\\\nfeeling, however, is not of an individual nature; for I believe I am\\\\r\\\\nright in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as a madrina.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n(Charles Darwin.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"After travelling about 14 miles, we were joined by three miners; and our\\\\r\\\\nmules, taking a sudden liking for their horses, jogged on at a more brisk\\\\r\\\\nrate. The instincts of the mulish heart form an interesting study to the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller in the mountains. I would (were the comparison not too\\\\r\\\\nungallant) liken it to a woman's; for it is quite as uncertain in its\\\\r\\\\nsympathies, bestowing its affections when least expected, and, when\\\\r\\\\nbestowed, quite as constant, so long as the object is not taken away.\\\\r\\\\nSometimes a horse, sometimes an ass, captivates the fancy of a whole\\\\r\\\\ndrove of mules, but often an animal nowise akin. Lieutenant Beale told me\\\\r\\\\nthat his whole train of mules once galloped off suddenly, on the plains\\\\r\\\\nof the Cimarone, and ran half a mile, when they halted in apparent\\\\r\\\\nsatisfaction. The cause of their freak was found to be a buffalo-calf,\\\\r\\\\nwhich had strayed from the herd. They were frisking around it in the\\\\r\\\\ngreatest delight, rubbing their noses against it, throwing up their\\\\r\\\\nheels, and making themselves ridiculous by abortive attempts to neigh and\\\\r\\\\nbray; while the poor calf, unconscious of its attractive qualities, stood\\\\r\\\\ntrembling in their midst. It is customary to have a horse in the\\\\r\\\\nmule-trains of the traders of North Mexico, as a sort of magnet to keep\\\\r\\\\ntogether the separate atoms of the train, for, whatever the temptation,\\\\r\\\\nthey will never stray from him.\\\\\\\" (Taylor's 'Eldorado.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAsses.--Notwithstanding his inveterate obstinacy, the ass is an excellent\\\\r\\\\nand sober little beast, far too much despised by us. He is not only the\\\\r\\\\nmost enduring, but also one of the quickest walkers among cattle, being\\\\r\\\\nusually promoted to the leadership of a caravan. He is nearly equal to\\\\r\\\\nthe camel in enduring thirst, and thrives on the poorest pasture, suffers\\\\r\\\\nfrom few diseases, and is unscathed by African distemper. The long\\\\r\\\\ndesert-roads and pilgrim-tracts of North Africa are largely travelled\\\\r\\\\nover by means of asses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAsses taught not to kick.--Mungo Park says that the negroes, where he\\\\r\\\\ntravelled, taught their asses as follows:--They cut a forked stick, and\\\\r\\\\nput the forked part into the ass's mouth, like the bit of a bridle; they\\\\r\\\\nthen tied the two smaller parts together above his head, leaving the\\\\r\\\\nlower part of sufficient length to strike against the ground if the ass\\\\r\\\\nshould attempt to put his head down. It always proved effectual.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNot to bray.--Messrs. Huc and Gabet, who were distracted by the continual\\\\r\\\\nbraying of one of their asses throughout the night, appealed to their\\\\r\\\\nmuleteer: he put a speedy close to the nuisance by what appears to be a\\\\r\\\\ncustomary contrivance in China, viz., by lashing a heavy stone to the\\\\r\\\\nbeast's tail. It appears that when an ass wants to bray he elevates his\\\\r\\\\ntail, and, if his tail be weighted down, he has not the heart to bray. In\\\\r\\\\nhostile neighbourhoods, where silence and concealment are sought, it\\\\r\\\\nmight be well to adopt this rather absurd treatment. An ass who was being\\\\r\\\\nschooled according to the method of this and the preceding paragraph,\\\\r\\\\nboth at the same time, would be worthy of an artist's sketch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOxen.--Though oxen are coarse, gross, and phlegmatic beasts, they have\\\\r\\\\nthese merits: they are eminently gregarious, and they ruminate their\\\\r\\\\nfood. The consequence is, first, that one, two, or more, are very seldom\\\\r\\\\nmissing out of a drove; and, secondly, that they pick up what they\\\\r\\\\nrequire, in a much shorter time than horses, mules, etc., who have to\\\\r\\\\nchew as they eat. Oxen require less tending than any other beasts of\\\\r\\\\nburden.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo train a Pack-ox.--An ox of any age, however wild he may be, can be\\\\r\\\\nbroken in, in three or four days, so as to carry a pack of about 70 lbs.;\\\\r\\\\nthough it is true that he will frequently kick it off during the journey,\\\\r\\\\nand give excessive trouble. It would be scarcely possible to drive more\\\\r\\\\nthan three of these newly-taught oxen at a time, on account of the\\\\r\\\\nfrequent delays caused by the unruliness of one or other of them. Muich\\\\r\\\\ndepends on the natural aptitude of the animal in estimating the time\\\\r\\\\nrequired for making a steady pack-ox, some will carry a good weight and\\\\r\\\\ngo steadily after only a fortnight's travel; some will never learn. But\\\\r\\\\nin all cases they prove unruly at the beginning of a journey.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo break-in an ox, take a long thong or cord, make a noose at one end of\\\\r\\\\nit, and let two or three men lay hold of the other; then, driving all the\\\\r\\\\nherd together in a clump, go in among them and, aided by a long stick,\\\\r\\\\npush or slip the noose round the hind leg of the ox that you want, and\\\\r\\\\ndraw tight. He will pull and struggle with all his might, and the other\\\\r\\\\noxen will disperse, leaving him alone dragging the men about after him.\\\\r\\\\nNext, let another man throw a noose round his horns, and the beast is,\\\\r\\\\ncomparatively speaking, secured. It is now convenient to throw the animal\\\\r\\\\ndown on his side, which is easily done by the judicious tugging at his\\\\r\\\\ntail and at the thongs. To keep him on the ground, let one man take the\\\\r\\\\ntail, and, passing it round one thigh, hold him down by that, while one\\\\r\\\\nor two men force the horns down against the ground. His nose has next to\\\\r\\\\nbe pierced. A stick, shaped like a Y, eight inches long, is cut of some\\\\r\\\\ntough wood; and the foot of it, being first sharpened, is forcibly poked\\\\r\\\\nthrough the wall that divides the nostrils, and a thin thong is tied\\\\r\\\\nfirmly to either end of this nose-stick. The thong is gathered together,\\\\r\\\\nand wound in a figure of 8 round the two horns, where it henceforward\\\\r\\\\nremains while the animal feeds, and by clutching at which, he is at any\\\\r\\\\ntime caught.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNext for the packing: as the ox lies on the ground, scrape a hole in the\\\\r\\\\nsand under his belly, and then, having laid a few skins on his back, pass\\\\r\\\\na thong round him and them, several times; tie the ends fast, and, taking\\\\r\\\\na stick, pass it through and twist it round, until the lashings are\\\\r\\\\nextremely tight, then let it be secured. Now let the ox go, and get\\\\r\\\\nquickly out of his way, in case he should be savage. When the ox gets up,\\\\r\\\\nhe is sulky and ferocious by turns; and kicks, jumps, and bellows, but at\\\\r\\\\nlast joins his companions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf he has been well packed, the skins will keep in place and not fall\\\\r\\\\noff; but whether they do or not, he must be re-caught and re-packed every\\\\r\\\\nday. A young ox is generally more difficult to break-in than an old one:\\\\r\\\\nI do not know why. An ox requires no pack-saddle; his back is too round\\\\r\\\\nto carry one with advantage. It is therefore usual to lay spare skins,\\\\r\\\\netc., upon him, and over these the bags that have to be packed. A great\\\\r\\\\nlength of thong is required to lash them. It is convenient to make a pair\\\\r\\\\nof very large saddle-bags out of skin or canvas, which require simply to\\\\r\\\\nbe placed on the ox's back and there girthed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo train an Ox to carry a Rider.--It takes a very long time to train an\\\\r\\\\nox to carry a riding-saddle well and steadily: indeed, very few oxen can\\\\r\\\\nbe taught to go wherever they may be guided by the rider; they are of so\\\\r\\\\ngregarious a nature, that, for the most part, they will not move a step\\\\r\\\\nwithout companions. Hence, those oxen only are thought worth breaking-in\\\\r\\\\nwhich are observed to take the part of leaders of the drove when\\\\r\\\\npasturing, and which are therefore supposed to have some independence of\\\\r\\\\ndisposition. The first time of mounting an ox to break him in, is a work\\\\r\\\\nof almost certain mischance: for the long horns of the ox will often\\\\r\\\\nreach the rider, however far back he may sit, and the animal kicks and\\\\r\\\\nbucks in a way that severely tries the best of seats. All riding-oxen's\\\\r\\\\nhorns should have the tips sawn off. After being mounted a very few\\\\r\\\\ntimes, the ox goes pretty steadily; but it is long before he learns to\\\\r\\\\ncarry a rider with ease to himself. I should like to hear if Rarey's plan\\\\r\\\\nof tying up the foreleg would influence them. Their character is so\\\\r\\\\nwholly unlike that of a horse, that I doubt if it would.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn riding, it must be recollected that the temper of an ox is far less\\\\r\\\\nquick, though his sensations may be as acute as those of a horse: thus,\\\\r\\\\nhe does not start forwards on receiving a cut with the whip, even though\\\\r\\\\nhe shrink with the pain; but he thinks about it, shakes his head, waits a\\\\r\\\\nwhile, and then breaks gradually into a faster pace. An ox will trot well\\\\r\\\\nenough with a light weight; and, though riding myself upwards of 13\\\\r\\\\nstone, I once took an ox 60 miles in a day and a half: this is, perhaps\\\\r\\\\nas much as an ox could, in fairness, be made to do. A ride-ox can be tied\\\\r\\\\nup by his nose-bridle; but, if wild or frightened, he will assuredly\\\\r\\\\nstruggle till the nose-stick be torn out of his nose, and he becomes\\\\r\\\\nfree. It is, therefore, better to tie the bridle to a tuft of grass, or a\\\\r\\\\nslender twig, rather than to a tree or to the saddle-bags. Mounting an ox\\\\r\\\\nis usually a troublesome business, on account of his horns. To make\\\\r\\\\nride-oxen quiet and tame, scratch their backs and tails--they dearly love\\\\r\\\\nit--and hold salt in your hands for them to lick. They soon learn their\\\\r\\\\nnames, and come to be caressed when called.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCows.--Most breeds of cows, out of Europe, cease to give milk after their\\\\r\\\\ncalf dies; and the only way of making them continue their yield, is to\\\\r\\\\nspread out the calf's hide for them to lick, some time before milking\\\\r\\\\nthem; it retains its effect for a week or more. Messrs. Huc and Gabet\\\\r\\\\ngive the following graphic account of this contrivance, as applied to\\\\r\\\\nrestive cows:--\\\\\\\"These long-tailed cows are so restive and difficult to\\\\r\\\\nmilk, that, to keep them at all quiet, the herdsman has to give them a\\\\r\\\\ncalf to lick meanwhile. But for this device, not a single drop of milk\\\\r\\\\ncould be obtained from them. One day a Lama herdsman, who lived in the\\\\r\\\\nsame house with ourselves, came, with a long dismal face, to announce\\\\r\\\\nthat his cow had calved during the night, and that unfortunately the calf\\\\r\\\\nwas dying. It died in the course of the day. The Lama forthwith skinned\\\\r\\\\nthe poor beast, and stuffed it with hay. This proceeding surprised us at\\\\r\\\\nfirst, for the Lama had by no means the air of a man likely to give\\\\r\\\\nhimself the luxury of a cabinet of natural history. When the operation\\\\r\\\\nwas completed, we observed that the hay-calf had neither feet nor head;\\\\r\\\\nwhereupon it occurred to us that, after all, it was perhaps a pillow that\\\\r\\\\nthe Lama contemplated. We were in error; but the error was not dissipated\\\\r\\\\ntill the next morning, when our herdsman went to milk his cow. Seeing him\\\\r\\\\nissue forth--the pail in one hand, the hay-calf under the other arm--the\\\\r\\\\nfancy occurred to us to follow him. His first proceeding was to put the\\\\r\\\\nhay-calf down before the cow. He then turned to milk the cow herself. The\\\\r\\\\nmamma at first opened enormous eyes at her beloved infant; by degrees she\\\\r\\\\nstooped her head towards it, then smelt at it, sneezed three or four\\\\r\\\\ntimes, and at last proceeded to lick it with the most delightful\\\\r\\\\ntenderness. This spectacle grated against our sensibilities: it seemed to\\\\r\\\\nus that he who first invented this parody upon one of the most touching\\\\r\\\\nincidents in nature must have been a man without a heart. A somewhat\\\\r\\\\nburlesque circumstance occurred one day, to modify the indignation with\\\\r\\\\nwhich this treachery inspired us. By dint of caressing and licking her\\\\r\\\\nlittle calf, the tender parent one fine morning unripped it: the hay\\\\r\\\\nissued from within; and the cow, manifesting not the slightest surprise\\\\r\\\\nnor agitation, proceeded tranquilly to devour the unexpected provender.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Highlanders used this contrivance, and called it a \\\\\\\"Tulchan\\\\\\\": hence\\\\r\\\\nKing James's bishops were nicknamed \\\\\\\"Tulchan bishops,\\\\\\\" to imply that they\\\\r\\\\nwere officials of straw, merely set up as a means of milking the Scotch\\\\r\\\\npeople of their money, in the form of church-dues.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCamels.--Camels are only fit for a few countries, and require practised\\\\r\\\\nattendants; thorns and rocks lame them, hills sadly impede them, and a\\\\r\\\\nwet slippery soil entirely stops them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nElephants.--They are expensive and delicate, but excellent beasts of\\\\r\\\\nburden, in rainy tropical countries. The traveller should make friends\\\\r\\\\nwith the one he regularly rides, by giving it a piece of sugar-cane or\\\\r\\\\nbanana before mounting. A sore back is a certain obstacle to a\\\\r\\\\ncontinuance of travel; there is no remedy for it but rest. The average\\\\r\\\\nburden, furniture included, but excluding the driver, is 500 lbs., and\\\\r\\\\nthe full average day's journey 15 miles.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDogs.--Dogs will draw a \\\\\\\"travail\\\\\\\" (which see) of 60 lbs. for 15 miles a\\\\r\\\\nday, over hard, level country, for days together; frequently they will\\\\r\\\\naccomplish much more than that. For Arctic travel, they are used in\\\\r\\\\njourneys after they are three years old; each dog requires eight or ten\\\\r\\\\nherrings per day, or an equivalent to them. A sledge of 12 dogs carries\\\\r\\\\n900 lbs.; it travels on smooth ice seven or eight miles an hour; and in\\\\r\\\\n36 days, 22 sledges and 240 dogs travelled 800 miles--1210 versts.\\\\r\\\\n(Admiral Wrangel.) Dogs are used by the Patagonian fishermen to drive\\\\r\\\\nfish into their nets, and to prevent them from breaking through the nets\\\\r\\\\nwhen they are inside them. (See next paragraph for \\\\\\\"Sheep-dogs.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGoats and Sheep.--Goats are much more troublesome to drive than sheep,\\\\r\\\\nneither are they such enduring walkers, nor do they give as much meat;\\\\r\\\\nbut their skins are of such great use to furnish strong leather, that it\\\\r\\\\nis seldom convenient to make up a caravan without them. She-goats give\\\\r\\\\nsome milk, even when travelling fast, and in dry countries; but a\\\\r\\\\newe-sheep is not worth milking under those circumstances, as her yield is\\\\r\\\\na mere nothing. Goats are very mischievous--they make their way out of\\\\r\\\\nall enclosures, and trespass everywhere. They butt at whatever is bright\\\\r\\\\nor new, or strange to them; and would drive an observer, who employed\\\\r\\\\nastronomical instruments on stands, to distraction. In an open country,\\\\r\\\\nwhere there are no bushes for a kraal, nets must be taken, and stakes\\\\r\\\\ncut, to make enclosures for the sheep. If they stray at all, the least\\\\r\\\\nthing scares them, and they will wander very far, and scatter. Goats are\\\\r\\\\nfar more social and intelligent. If one, two, or three sheep only be\\\\r\\\\ndriven, long thongs must be tied to their legs, and allowed to trail\\\\r\\\\nalong the ground, by which they may be re-caught if they gallop off. When\\\\r\\\\nthe Messrs. Schlagintweit were encamped at vast heights, among the snows\\\\r\\\\nof the Himalaya, they always found it practicable to drive sheep to their\\\\r\\\\nstations. When sheep, etc., are long hurdled at night, near the same\\\\r\\\\nencampment, the nuisance of flies and ticks becomes intolerable.\\\\r\\\\nSheep-dogs seem to prove of less use to travellers than might have been\\\\r\\\\nexpected; perhaps the other dogs corrupt them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nManagement of Cattle generally.--To make an animal rise when he throws\\\\r\\\\nhimself on the ground with his pack, and will not get up, it is not of\\\\r\\\\nmuch use to flog him; twisting or biting his tail is the usual way, or\\\\r\\\\nmaking a blaze with grass and a few sticks under his nostrils. The\\\\r\\\\nstubborness of a half-broken ox is sometimes beyond conception.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCattle Bells, in countries where they can be used without danger, should\\\\r\\\\nalways be taken; it adds greatly to the cheerfulness and gregariousness\\\\r\\\\nof the animals--mules positively require them. Hard wood is sonorous\\\\r\\\\nenough for bells.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBrands and Cattle-marks.--In buying oxen out of the herds of pastoral\\\\r\\\\npeople, it is very difficult to remember each animal so as to recognise\\\\r\\\\nit again if it strays back to its former home; it requires quite a\\\\r\\\\npeculiar talent to do so. Therefore it is advisable that the traveller's\\\\r\\\\ncattle should be marked or branded. A trader in Namaqua Land, took red\\\\r\\\\npaint, and tied a brush on to a long stick; with this he made a daub on\\\\r\\\\nthe hind quarters of the freshly-bought and half-wild cattle, as they\\\\r\\\\npushed through the door of his kraal. It naturally excites great ridicule\\\\r\\\\namong natives, to paint an ox that he may be known again; but, for all\\\\r\\\\nthat, I think the trader's plan well worth adopting. The same might be\\\\r\\\\ndone to sheep, as a slit ear is not half conspicuous enough. A good way\\\\r\\\\nof marking a sheep's ear is to cut a wad out of the middle of it, with a\\\\r\\\\ngun-punch; but it will sometimes tear this hole into a slit, by\\\\r\\\\nscratching with its foot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChaff, to cut.--Tie a sickle against a tree, with its blade projecting;\\\\r\\\\nthen, standing in front of the blade, hold a handful of reeds across it\\\\r\\\\nwith both hands, one hand on either side of the blade; pull it towards\\\\r\\\\nyou, and the reeds will be cut through; drop the cut end, seize the\\\\r\\\\nbundle afresh, and repeat the process. In this way, after a little\\\\r\\\\npractice, chaff is cut with great ease and quickness. A broken sickle\\\\r\\\\ndoes as well as a whole one, and a knife may be used, but the curve of\\\\r\\\\nits edge is ill adapted for the work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCattle will eat many sorts of herbage, as reeds and gorse, if cut small;\\\\r\\\\nbut will not touch them, if uncut.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOccasional Food for Cattle.--They will also eat seaweed and leaves\\\\r\\\\nespecially birch and poplar leaves, and even thrive upon them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration of man cutting chaff as described on p 64].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPulling Cattle out of Holes.--The bight of a cord, or of some substitute\\\\r\\\\nfor one, may be thrown over a horse's head, and he can be dragged out by\\\\r\\\\na team of cattle with but very little danger to his neck. A crupper under\\\\r\\\\nhis tail, or a thong as a breeching may be used. In Canada and the United\\\\r\\\\nStates, a noose of rope is often run round the horse's neck, and hauled\\\\r\\\\ntight--thus temporarily choking the animal and making him still; he is\\\\r\\\\nthen pulled as quickly as possible out of the hole, and no time is lost\\\\r\\\\nin slackening the rope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHARNESS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSaddles for riding.--Good saddles for riding, and, I may add, especially\\\\r\\\\nfor packing, are of nearly as great importance as the goodness of the\\\\r\\\\nanimal who carries them. English saddlers never, I believe, can be\\\\r\\\\ninduced to stuff a saddle sufficiently; because they have no opportunity\\\\r\\\\nof seeing the miserable, scraggy condition of a travelled horse's back,\\\\r\\\\nto which it is destined to fit. But an English saddle, restuffed at a\\\\r\\\\nbush frontier town, is excellent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree rings, and nine of what saddlers call \\\\\\\"D's,\\\\\\\" should be fixed to the\\\\r\\\\nsaddle, not simply into the leather-work, but firmly riveted or secured\\\\r\\\\ninto the tree itself. This must be especially insisted on, or frequent\\\\r\\\\ndisasters will occur. The three rings are to be fixed to the pommel--one\\\\r\\\\non the top, and one on each side of it; the nine \\\\\\\"D's\\\\\\\" are placed as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--three along the back of the saddle, two more on each side of\\\\r\\\\nthe seat, and two in front, for the breastplate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFittings.--To these may be tied a light valise in front; a gun-holster on\\\\r\\\\nthe right of the pommel; and a small bag--containing odds and ends,\\\\r\\\\ngunpowder, spare bullets, a few presents, etc.--on its left. On the right\\\\r\\\\nof the seat, a sabre-tasch, or thin leather portfolio-shaped pocket, for\\\\r\\\\npaper and writing materials; on the left, the water-canteen and hobbles;\\\\r\\\\nbehind, the crupper and small saddle-bags. A breastplate is not worth\\\\r\\\\nhaving, except in a very hilly country. This description of a saddle, of\\\\r\\\\ncourse, applies to that of the travelling-horse. For the saddle of the\\\\r\\\\nshooting-horse the arrangement is different; only the gun-holster, and\\\\r\\\\nperhaps the water-canteen can then be taken. An ox carries a saddle\\\\r\\\\nprecisely like a horse. I rode mine nearly 1600 miles, in South Africa,\\\\r\\\\nwith a common hunting-saddle and its ordinary girths.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn default of riding-saddles, a pack-saddle must be cushioned to form a\\\\r\\\\ncomfortable seat (see \\\\\\\"Pack-saddles\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSaddle-bags are so troublesome to open, and require so many straps, that\\\\r\\\\nI believe it is best to use a bag of macintosh or canvas, rolled up and\\\\r\\\\ntied behind the saddle, where it should rest on a pad. The pad is made of\\\\r\\\\ntwo cushions, each 9 inches long and 4 broad, sewn on a piece of leather,\\\\r\\\\nlying parallel to one another, and 4 inches apart. The space between the\\\\r\\\\ncushions corresponds to the backbone of the horse. To keep the whole in\\\\r\\\\nshape, it is usual to stitch four or five laths of wood lengthways to the\\\\r\\\\nupper surface of the pad; upon these laths the bag will rest. If there be\\\\r\\\\noccasion to carry a bag on horseback for a short distance, pass one of\\\\r\\\\nthe stirrup-leathers through its string; then throw the bag over to the\\\\r\\\\nother side of the saddle: it will lie behind the rider's leg, and be out\\\\r\\\\nof his way and he will sit upon part of its string.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAustralians, as is well known, insist on the merits of a \\\\\\\"swag,\\\\\\\" or a\\\\r\\\\nlong package formed by rolling all their possessions into their blanket.\\\\r\\\\nThey carry it over the saddle-bows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSore backs.--Sore backs are the plague of beasts of burden; for, if the\\\\r\\\\nskin be once broken, it will never heal thoroughly again during the whole\\\\r\\\\njourney. Every precaution should, therefore, be taken at first starting:\\\\r\\\\nthe saddles should be well-stuffed; the saddle-cloths ample, and without\\\\r\\\\nhem or edging (blankets are as good as any); the journeys should be\\\\r\\\\nshort; the packs light and carefully balanced; rests of a day or two\\\\r\\\\nshould frequently be given, and salt-water should be rubbed on the back.\\\\r\\\\nTravelling in the very early morning is found to be bad for animals'\\\\r\\\\nbacks; but travelling late at night is not so. An Australian\\\\r\\\\ncorrespondent remarks, that a party of travellers or explorers in\\\\r\\\\nAustralia, on leaving their camp, invariably saddle their horses with\\\\r\\\\nample saddle-cloths below the saddle, and assist each other by turns, to\\\\r\\\\nfold the cloths in various ways. For instance, if the ridge of the back,\\\\r\\\\nor wither, should be found galled, the cloth would be folded up, so that\\\\r\\\\nthe saddle should rest entirely on the two folded pads, as in the\\\\r\\\\nfigure.--Other modes of folding will suggest themselves, according to the\\\\r\\\\nway in which the back may be rubbed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Drawing of folded saddle-cloth].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe first appearance of a sore back is a small hardish swelling or\\\\r\\\\nwarble\\\\\\\" this must at once be attended to, either by folding the\\\\r\\\\nsaddle-cloth in some appropriate way, or by picking out the\\\\r\\\\nsaddle-stuffing, so as to ease all pressure from off it; otherwise, it\\\\r\\\\nwill get larger and larger, and a single day will convert what might have\\\\r\\\\nbeen easily cured, into a serious and irremediable gall. Girth-galls, on\\\\r\\\\ntheir first appearance, may be relieved if not cured, by sewing two rolls\\\\r\\\\nof soft woollen material on to the girth. The hair from the animal's mane\\\\r\\\\nor tail has been used on an emergency to stuff a saddle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 1, 2, 3 show different pack saddles].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPack-Saddles.--To make when Travelling.--Cut four bent pieces of touch\\\\r\\\\nwood, and two small planks; season them as well as you can (see \\\\\\\"Wood, to\\\\r\\\\nseason\\\\\\\"), and join them together, as in figs. 1 and 2, using raw hide in\\\\r\\\\naddition to nails or pegs. Stuffed cushions must be secured inside the\\\\r\\\\nplanks by tying or otherwise. With a saw and a mortise-chisel, a saddle\\\\r\\\\nof the pattern shown in fig. 3 would be easy to make. It is stronger than\\\\r\\\\nthe one just described, and the notched cross-bar is very convenient for\\\\r\\\\nthe pack-ropes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPack-Saddles made by Saddlers.--There has been, perhaps, no journey in\\\\r\\\\nwhich pack-horses worked so effectively as during the exploration of\\\\r\\\\nNorth Australia under Mr. Gregory. I am much indebted to Mr. Baines, the\\\\r\\\\nartist of the expedition, who has subsequently travelled extensively, for\\\\r\\\\nthe following very interesting account:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The pack-saddles were made after a model by Mr. Gregory, and are the\\\\r\\\\nbest I have yet seen. Two boards of light wood are connected by bows of\\\\r\\\\niron, 1 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick, with hooks inserted in either\\\\r\\\\nside, for the pack-bags to hook on to. The straps for the breastings,\\\\r\\\\nbreechings, and girths, were screwed to the boards; the crupper passed\\\\r\\\\nthrough a ring on the after bow; and a light pad, which could easily be\\\\r\\\\ntaken out to be re-stuffed, was secured by small thongs, passed through\\\\r\\\\nholes in the ends of the boards. We had two girths, which crossed each\\\\r\\\\nother under the horse. (In unloading, the neck-strap is unbuckled on the\\\\r\\\\nnear side, also the breasting and girths; and the whole is drawn off\\\\r\\\\nbehind.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and 2 and an un-labelled figure on this page further illustrate\\\\r\\\\npacking].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The pack-bags were made of one width of canvas, turned up so as to have\\\\r\\\\nno seam in the bottom. Pear-shaped pieces were sewn in to form the ends,\\\\r\\\\nand rope was stitched along the seams, having eyes above, by which the\\\\r\\\\nbag was hung upon the hooks (fig. 2). The flour-bags were made of canvas,\\\\r\\\\nof the usual width, with a round bottom stitched into them. The mouth was\\\\r\\\\nsewn up when full, and an oiled bag of the same size drawn over it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"When all our horses were saddled up, the word 'on packs' was given. Dr.\\\\r\\\\nMueller and I used to work together, and had our packs laid out in pairs;\\\\r\\\\nso that when each horse was led between his bags, we hooked them on at\\\\r\\\\nthe same moment. When we halted, we laid our bags on a couple of poles,\\\\r\\\\nto keep them from the ground, as in the drawing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The bags sometimes came off when we were travelling; but it was\\\\r\\\\ngenerally easy to catch the horse and reload him. When a horse rolled\\\\r\\\\nover, or fell in a river, it was rather an advantage than otherwise to\\\\r\\\\nget clear of them. Our waterproof bags were of leather, lined with\\\\r\\\\nwaterproof cloth, just large enough to fill one of the canvas pack-bags.\\\\r\\\\nThey had a brass neck with a worm inside, in which we screwed a plug of\\\\r\\\\nsoft wood. (There was rarely, if ever, occasion to use them.) Each pair\\\\r\\\\nof bags was carefully balanced, one against the other, that the horses\\\\r\\\\nmight not be unequally loaded. The average weight of stores carried in\\\\r\\\\neach bag was 75 lbs., making a load (at starting) or 150 lbs., exclusive\\\\r\\\\nof bags, packages, or saddlery. Bells were attached to the necks of the\\\\r\\\\nhorses most apt to stray; but the clappers were tied up with a piece of\\\\r\\\\nthong, to keep them quiet on the march; and were loosened at night, so\\\\r\\\\nthat the sound might guide us in searching for them next morning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of saddle bags on tree].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"We watched two hours each during night; the morning watch boiled the\\\\r\\\\nwater, and woke the rest at four. We made our breakfast of tea or coffee,\\\\r\\\\ndamper, and pork, which we ate raw, and went out for the horses; which\\\\r\\\\nwere generally saddled up, and on the move, before sunrise. We travelled\\\\r\\\\ntill one or two, when we led the horses to water, looked to any sores\\\\r\\\\nthat might be caused by the pressure of their saddles, dressed them and\\\\r\\\\naltered the stuffing of the saddle to give them relief, and, after\\\\r\\\\ndinner, which was rather a brief ceremony, had the rest of the day for\\\\r\\\\nscientific or artistic pursuits,--that is, if something else did not\\\\r\\\\nrequire immediate attention. We could never trust to our guns for\\\\r\\\\nprovision, as game was very scarce, and we had no opportunity of seeking\\\\r\\\\nit.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSir Samuel Baker gave considerable attention to the subject of\\\\r\\\\npack-saddles. The following is his account of the method he adopted in\\\\r\\\\nAfrica:--\\\\\\\"I had arranged their (the donkeys') packs so well, that they\\\\r\\\\ncarried their loads with the greatest comfort. Each animal had an immense\\\\r\\\\npad, well stuffed with goats' hair; this rested from the shoulder to the\\\\r\\\\nhip bones; upon this rested a simple form of saddle made of two forks of\\\\r\\\\nboughs inverted, and fastened together with rails; there were no nails in\\\\r\\\\nthese saddles, all the fastenings being secured with thongs of raw hide.\\\\r\\\\nthe great pad projecting before and behind, and also below the side of\\\\r\\\\nthe saddle, prevented the loads from chafing the animal. Every donkey\\\\r\\\\ncarried two large bags made from the hides of antelopes that I had\\\\r\\\\nformerly shot on the frontier of Abyssinia, and these were arranged with\\\\r\\\\ntoggles on the one to fit into loops on the other, so that the loading\\\\r\\\\nand unloading was exceedingly simple. The success of an expedition\\\\r\\\\ndepends mainly upon the perfection of the details, and, where animals are\\\\r\\\\nemployed for transport, the first consideration should be bestowed upon\\\\r\\\\nsaddle-packs. The facility of loading is all-important, and I now had an\\\\r\\\\nexemplification of its effect upon both animals and men; the latter began\\\\r\\\\nto abuse the camels and to curse the father of this, and the mother of\\\\r\\\\nthat, because they had the trouble of unloading them for the descent into\\\\r\\\\nthe river's bed, while the donkeys were blessed with the endearing name\\\\r\\\\nof 'my brother,' and alternately whacked with the stick.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe art of packing.--The art of good packing is to balance the packs\\\\r\\\\naccurately, and to lash tightly to the saddle, so that they will never\\\\r\\\\nslip. The entire load is then secured to the animal's back, by moderate\\\\r\\\\ngirthing. It is going on a false principle, to wind one long cord round\\\\r\\\\nthe horse, saddle, and packs; making, as it were, a great faggot of them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo tighten the lashings of a pack, thrust a stick through them, twist it\\\\r\\\\nforcibly round and round, till the lashings are screwed tight enough, and\\\\r\\\\nthen secure the stick.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHalf-filled sacks require to have laths of wood, or a handful of twigs,\\\\r\\\\nput between them and the packing-cord, to equalise its pressure;\\\\r\\\\notherwise, they are strangled out of shape and never lie firmly against\\\\r\\\\nthe saddle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Harness.--Cruppers.--A crupper rope should be passed through a\\\\r\\\\nleather tube, fitting it loosely. Cruppers for pack-saddles, adapted to\\\\r\\\\nvery mountainous countries, like those used in Norway, can readily be\\\\r\\\\nmade by travellers. Instead of employing a ring to enclose the tail of\\\\r\\\\nthe beast (which is sure to fret its sides), he should pass a curved bar\\\\r\\\\nof wood, a foot long, underneath the tail, and tie a cord to the\\\\r\\\\npack-saddle, from either end of the bar.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGirths.--A roll of spare webbing should be taken to patch up torn girths;\\\\r\\\\nbut a good substitute for a girth is made by cutting a band of tanned, or\\\\r\\\\neven of dressed, leather, to within four inches of its end, into seven or\\\\r\\\\nnine bands, and plaiting these together. But it takes a beginner just ten\\\\r\\\\ntimes as long to plait a girth as to weave it, and, therefore, for making\\\\r\\\\nmore than one girth, it is well worth while to set up a rude loom. Do\\\\r\\\\nthis as though you were making a mat. (See \\\\\\\"Mat.\\\\\\\") Girths need not be\\\\r\\\\nbuckled; they may be laced.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStirrups must be very roomy, enough to admit clumsily-shaped shoes, such\\\\r\\\\nas are made in the bush; they must be broad under the sole of the foot,\\\\r\\\\nand also at the place which rubs against the little toe. Unless they are\\\\r\\\\nheavy, it is not easy to find them with the foot; travellers in South\\\\r\\\\nAfrica cut them out from any thick raw hide--that of giraffe,\\\\r\\\\nrhinoceros, or sea-cow does admirably. A wooden stirrup may be cut or\\\\r\\\\nburnt out of a block. It should have lead melted into it to give it\\\\r\\\\nsufficient weight. A stick and a thong, as shown in the figure, is a poor\\\\r\\\\nmakeshift. Willow, or any other lithe wood, is easily bent into the\\\\r\\\\nrequired shape, especially if its outer edge be nicked with a knife;\\\\r\\\\notherwise it would be a mere loop of wood, such as it represented in the\\\\r\\\\nnext figure but two, in the paragraph on Rings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of foot and stirrup].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBridles and Bits.--Leave behind all English notions of snaffles and\\\\r\\\\ndouble reins, and ride with nothing but an easy curb. The horse must also\\\\r\\\\ncarry a headstall and a halter; I like one with plenty of tassels, to\\\\r\\\\nkeep off the flies. A temporary substitute for a curb is made by noosing\\\\r\\\\na string, and putting the noose round the horse's lower jaw. If the\\\\r\\\\nstring be long enough, it can be doubled back again, and tied to the\\\\r\\\\nother side of the noose, so as to make a complete bridle. The groom's\\\\r\\\\nfashion of giving the halter a hitch, and putting it round the jaw, is\\\\r\\\\nwell known.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuckles.--A contrivance like this will often be found useful to replace a\\\\r\\\\nbuckle and strap; by twisting the lower thong more tightly, its length\\\\r\\\\ncan be shortened as much as may be required. If the tongue of a buckle\\\\r\\\\nbreaks, a nail or a peg, pushed through the buckle-hole, as in the figure\\\\r\\\\nbelow will replace it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Three sketches to illustrate items described on this page].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Padlock a Bag.--A padlock, passed through the next buckle-hole, as is\\\\r\\\\nalso shown in the same figure, prevents pilferers from unbuckling and\\\\r\\\\nopening the package. It is well to learn some artful sailor's-knot for\\\\r\\\\ntying up bags, with which other people cannot meddle without your finding\\\\r\\\\nit out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRings.--In packing-gear and other harness, use is frequently made of\\\\r\\\\nrings. Iron ones may be replaced by a loop of tough wood, such as the\\\\r\\\\npeasants of the Campagna commonly employ: a piece of the thickness of a\\\\r\\\\nsmall walking-stick, and eight inches long, is bent (see \\\\\\\"Wood, to bend\\\\\\\");\\\\r\\\\nits arms are notched when they cross, and are firmly nailed or lashed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTethers, Hobbles, and Knee-halters.--Cattle may be secured at night by\\\\r\\\\nbeing tethered, hobbled, knee-haltered, or driven into an enclosure made\\\\r\\\\nof bushes. The nature of the country, and what dangers are apprehended,\\\\r\\\\ndetermine which plan is most advisable. A knee-haltered horse has a good\\\\r\\\\nchange of escape if he scents a wild beast that is creeping up to him;\\\\r\\\\nfor he can gallop, though with labour, to a short distance. A hobbled\\\\r\\\\nhorse has no chance at all; though, indeed, they have been known to fight\\\\r\\\\ndesperately with their teeth and feet, and learn to be cunning and\\\\r\\\\nwatchful. If the hobbles are of iron, and made like handcuffs, it is\\\\r\\\\nhardly possible for robbers--at all events for savages--to unlock or cut\\\\r\\\\nthem. A horse that is hobbled or knee-haltered, can graze during the\\\\r\\\\nnight; but if tied up or pounded, his grass must be cut for him. A horse\\\\r\\\\nmay be successfully hobbled with a stirrup-leather, by putting its middle\\\\r\\\\nround one fetlock, then twisting it half-a-dozen times, and, lastly,\\\\r\\\\nbuckling it round the other fetlock. The hobble used by Mr. Gregory takes\\\\r\\\\ninto five separate pieces, viz., two fetlock straps, a1, a2; a chain, b,\\\\r\\\\nhaving a swivel point, c, in the middle; and two double pot-hooks, d1,\\\\r\\\\nd2, which pass through eyes in the fetlock straps, and also through the\\\\r\\\\nend links in the chain. The two ends of both, d1 and d2, are thickened\\\\r\\\\nand pierced, so as to admit of tying a thong across their mouths, as\\\\r\\\\nshown on one side of d2. The fetlock strap is made of a strip of thick\\\\r\\\\nleather, folded lengthways down its middle, and having its edges sewn\\\\r\\\\ntogether. The sewn edge should always be the uppermost, when on the\\\\r\\\\nhorse's legs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Two sketches on this page illustrating equipment].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOxen are often picketed to their yokes; I have already mentioned that it\\\\r\\\\nis hazardous to secure ride and pack oxen by their nose reams, as they\\\\r\\\\nwill tear themselves loose without heeding the pain, if really\\\\r\\\\nfrightened. Horses are often tied to the wheels, etc., of the wagon. When\\\\r\\\\nyou wish to picket horses in the middle of a sandy plain, dig a hole two\\\\r\\\\nor three feet deep, and tying your rope to a faggot of sticks or\\\\r\\\\nbrush-wood, or even to a bag filled with sand, bury this in it. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Dateram.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSwivel.--The woodcut shows how a makeshift swivel can be fitted to a\\\\r\\\\ntether rope. Without one, the rope will be twisted almost up to a knot by\\\\r\\\\nthe horse walking round and round his picket peg; with one, the rope will\\\\r\\\\nturn freely in the hole, through which its large knotted head prevents it\\\\r\\\\nfrom being drawn.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[This page has two sketches showing material described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe figure below is a better sort of swivel. It must be made of hard\\\\r\\\\ntough wood, like oak: it is six inches in length. It has, I presume, some\\\\r\\\\nadvantages over those of iron, because in countries where iron abounds,\\\\r\\\\nas in Piedmont, it holds its ground against them. The ropes have been\\\\r\\\\ndrawn thinner than their just proportion, for the sake of distinctness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI give a drawing of yet another description of swivel; it is a trifle\\\\r\\\\nmore complicated than the first, but I am assured that it acts so much\\\\r\\\\nbetter as to be greatly preferable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHorse-collar.--This, in its simplest form, consists of two stout bars\\\\r\\\\nthat are a little bent or shaped with a knife; they go one on either side\\\\r\\\\nof the animal's neck, and are tied together both above and below it. To\\\\r\\\\nthese bars, which are very thickly padded, the traces are fastened.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTraces and Trektows can be made of raw hide, cut into a long thong, then\\\\r\\\\nbent into three parts, and twisted and laid together, as is done in\\\\r\\\\nrope-making; the whole is then stretched tight between two trees to dry.\\\\r\\\\nAn ox-hide will make a trektow for four pairs of oxen. Poles of wood are\\\\r\\\\nvery generally used as traces; a thong, or a few links of chain, being\\\\r\\\\nfastened at either end, by which to attach them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGreasing Harness.--In dry climates take frequent opportunities of\\\\r\\\\ngreasing every part of the harness. (See \\\\\\\"Hides; Leather, to grease.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCARRIAGES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWagons.--A traveller's wagon should be of the simplest possible\\\\r\\\\nconstruction, and not too heavy. The Cape wagons, or, at all events,\\\\r\\\\nthose of a few years back, undoubtedly shared the ponderousness of all\\\\r\\\\nDutch workmanship. Weight is required only when crashing through a bushy\\\\r\\\\ncountry, where a wagon must break down all before it: in every other case\\\\r\\\\nit is objectionable. It is a saving of labour to have one large wagon,\\\\r\\\\nrather than two small ones, because a driver and a leader are thereby\\\\r\\\\nspared. But if a very light wagon has to be taken, I should greatly\\\\r\\\\nprefer its being made on the Swiss and German fashion, with a shifting\\\\r\\\\nperch as in the figure\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Drawing of fastening].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThese are the simplest of affairs, and will split up into two carts--the\\\\r\\\\npole and the fore-wheels forming one, and the perch and the hind-wheels\\\\r\\\\nanother: now, should a great loss occur among the traveller's cattle, or\\\\r\\\\nshould he break a wheel, or even strain an axle-tree, in a timberless\\\\r\\\\ncountry, it may be very convenient to him to abandon part of his stores,\\\\r\\\\nand to build up a cart for carrying on the remainder. Lady Vavasour\\\\r\\\\ndescribes one of these wagons in the following graphic manner:--\\\\\\\"The\\\\r\\\\nperch is moveable, and they can make it any length they please; it is of\\\\r\\\\nso simple a construction that every farmer can repair his own, and make\\\\r\\\\nanything of it. If he has a perch, a pole, and four wheels, that is\\\\r\\\\nenough; with a little ingenuity, he makes it carry stones, hay, earth, or\\\\r\\\\nanything he wants, by putting a plank at each side. When he wants a\\\\r\\\\ncarriage for pleasure, he fits it up for that purpose; his moveable perch\\\\r\\\\nallows him to make it anything. I counted seventeen grown persons sitting\\\\r\\\\nside by side, looking most happy, in one of them, drawn only by a pair of\\\\r\\\\nsmall horses, and in this hilly country.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrays.--Two-wheeled drays, and not wagons, are used very generally in\\\\r\\\\nAustralia. A long bar is crossed by a short one near one of its\\\\r\\\\nends,--this latter forms the axletree; the body of the dray is built\\\\r\\\\nwhere the two cross; and the cattle are yoked or harnessed to the long\\\\r\\\\nend of the bar, which acts as a pole.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTarring Wheels.--Tar is absolutely essential in a hot country, to mix\\\\r\\\\nwith the grease that is used for the wagon-wheels. Grease, alone, melts\\\\r\\\\nand runs away like water: the object of the tar is to give consistency to\\\\r\\\\nthe grease; a very small proportion of tar suffices, but without any at\\\\r\\\\nall, a wagon is soon brought to a standstill. It is, therefore, most\\\\r\\\\nessential to explorers to have a sufficient quantity in reserve. Tar is\\\\r\\\\nalso of very great use in hot dry countries for daubing over the wheels,\\\\r\\\\nand the woodwork generally, of wagons. During extreme heat, when the wood\\\\r\\\\nis ready to crack, all the paint should be scraped off it, and the tar\\\\r\\\\napplied plentifully. It will soak in deeply, and preserve the wood in\\\\r\\\\nexcellent condition, both during the drought and the ensuing wet season.\\\\r\\\\n(See \\\\\\\"Tar, to make.\\\\\\\") It is not necessary to take off the wheels in order\\\\r\\\\nto grease the axles. It is sufficient to bore an auger-hole right through\\\\r\\\\nthe substance of the nave, between the feet of two of the spokes, and to\\\\r\\\\nkeep a plug in the hole. Then, when you want to tar a wheel, turn it till\\\\r\\\\nthe hole is uppermost, take the plug out, and pour in the tar.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBreaks and Drags.--Breaks.--Every cart and wagon in Switzerland, and,\\\\r\\\\nindeed, in most parts of the Continent, has a break attached to it: the\\\\r\\\\nsimplest kind of break is shown in fig. 2, which represents a cart tilted\\\\r\\\\nupwards. Fig 1 shows the break itself; fig. 2 explains how it is fitted\\\\r\\\\non to the cart. [Fig 1.] It will easily be understood how, by tightening\\\\r\\\\nthe free end of the cord, the break is pressed against the wheels. The\\\\r\\\\nbent piece of iron shown in fig. 2, by which the bar of the break is kept\\\\r\\\\nin its place, may be replaced by a piece of wood, or even by a thong of\\\\r\\\\nleather. Every explorer's wagon should be furnished with a break.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA simple break, used in Italy, in some parts of England and probably\\\\r\\\\nelsewhere, is shown in fig. 3. A rail is lashed to the body of the cart,\\\\r\\\\nboth before and behind the wheel, and is made to press against the wheel.\\\\r\\\\nEither both lashings can be tightened at the same time, as at A, A; or\\\\r\\\\nonly one of them, as at B. When the lashings are loose, the rail rests\\\\r\\\\npartly on the nave of the wheel and does not sensibly interfere with its\\\\r\\\\nmovement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 3].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Means of Checking a Wagon on a Hill-side.--In going down a steep\\\\r\\\\nhill a middling-sized tree may be felled, and its root tied to the hind\\\\r\\\\naxletree, while its branchy top sweeps along the ground, as is seen in\\\\r\\\\nthe lowermost wagon in the sketch. [Sketch of horses and wagons on hill]\\\\r\\\\nIn the south-west of France the leaders of the team are unharnessed and\\\\r\\\\ntaken to the back of the wagon, to which the collar of the front horse is\\\\r\\\\nmade fast; in this way they can aid the horses in the shafts. The same\\\\r\\\\nplan may be seen practised hourly in the Strand in London, whence heavy\\\\r\\\\nwagons are taken down a very steep and narrow lane to the Adelphi.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn descending short steep pitches, unharness the cattle, and \\\\\\\"fasten a\\\\r\\\\nrope round the axle of the wagon; then passing the other end round a tree\\\\r\\\\nor rock as a check, you may let her slide, which she will do without any\\\\r\\\\nfurther trouble on your part.\\\\\\\" (F. Marryat.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn some places the hind wheels are taken off, and sledge runners are\\\\r\\\\nfitted to the hind axletree. This is an excellent plan; it has the\\\\r\\\\nfurther advantage that the wagon settles down into a more horizontal\\\\r\\\\nposition than before. I have seen timber carried on a wagon down a steep\\\\r\\\\nhill by separating the front wheels from the hind ones, lashing a trail\\\\r\\\\n(see \\\\\\\"Travail\\\\\\\" below) or two short poles to the fore axletree, and\\\\r\\\\nresting one end of the timber on the hind axletree, and the other end on\\\\r\\\\nthe trail.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShoe the wheel on the side furthest from the precipice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you have to leave a cart or wagon untended for a while, lock the\\\\r\\\\nwheel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of loaded sledge].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSledges.--When carrying wood or stones, and doing other heavy work, a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller should spare his wagon and use a sledge. This is made by\\\\r\\\\ncutting down a forked tree, lopping off its branches, and shaping it a\\\\r\\\\nlittle with an axe. If necessary, a few bars may be fixed across the fork\\\\r\\\\nso as to make a stage. Great distances may be traversed by one of these\\\\r\\\\nrude affairs, if the country is not very stony. Should it capsize, no\\\\r\\\\ngreat harm is done; and if it breaks down, or is found to have been badly\\\\r\\\\nmade, an hour's labour will suffice to construct another. Sledges are\\\\r\\\\nvery useful where there is an abundance of horse or ox power, but no\\\\r\\\\nwagon or packing-gear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNorth American Travail.--In a North American Indian horse \\\\\\\"travail,\\\\\\\" the\\\\r\\\\ncrossing of the poles (they are the poles of the wigwams) usually rests\\\\r\\\\non a rough pack-saddle or pad, which a breast-strap keeps from slipping\\\\r\\\\nbackwards. In a dog travail the cross of the poles rests on the back of\\\\r\\\\nthe neck, and is kept in place by a breast or rather a neck strap; the\\\\r\\\\npoles are wrapped with pieces of buffalo robe where they press against\\\\r\\\\nthe dog. Captain Blakiston--a very accurate authority--considers that a\\\\r\\\\nhorse will travel 30 miles in the day, dragging on the travail a weight\\\\r\\\\nof about 200 lbs., including a child, whose mother sits on the horse's\\\\r\\\\nback; and that a dog, the size of an average retriever, will draw about\\\\r\\\\n80 lbs. for the same distance. (N.B. The North American plains are\\\\r\\\\nperfectly level.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of horse with \\\\\\\"travail\\\\\\\"].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPalanquins, carried like sedan-chairs, between two animals--one going\\\\r\\\\nbefore the other in shafts--are in use in various countries; but I am not\\\\r\\\\naware that explorers have ever properly tried them. Their advantage would\\\\r\\\\nlie in combining the convenience of a cart with much of the independence\\\\r\\\\nof pack-horses. For whatever is lashed on a pack-saddle must be securely\\\\r\\\\ntied up; it is therefore severely compressed, and cannot be taken out en\\\\r\\\\nroute. But with a cart or a palanquin there is no such inconvenience:\\\\r\\\\nthings may be quickly thrown into them or taken out; pockets and drawers\\\\r\\\\nmay be fitted up; and the palanquin would afford some shelter in rain. I\\\\r\\\\nshould think it would be well worth while to try one of these\\\\r\\\\ncontrivances. It might be made en route; first accustoming the animals,\\\\r\\\\nwhen carrying their packs, to walk between long shafts, then, after some\\\\r\\\\ndays, taking the load off their saddles, and lashing them on to the\\\\r\\\\nshafts. If all went well, a regular palanquin might be constructed with\\\\r\\\\nlegs, to be let down when the animals are off-packed, and on which it\\\\r\\\\nmight stand until ready to be again carried onwards. Half-a-dozen\\\\r\\\\npalanquins in file would make a pretty, and, I should think, a manageable\\\\r\\\\nand effective caravan. Asses ought to be able to carry them well; a\\\\r\\\\ncouple of asses would probably carry a greater weight than a single\\\\r\\\\npack-horse, and would give no greater trouble; if so, their hardiness\\\\r\\\\nwould be invaluable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSWIMMING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Rate of Swimming. People swim much more slowly than is\\\\r\\\\ncommonly supposed. In races between first-rate swimmers, for distances of\\\\r\\\\n300 yards and upwards, the average pace of two miles an hour is barely,\\\\r\\\\nif at all, exceeded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLearning to Swim.--A good way of teaching a person to swim, is a\\\\r\\\\nmodification of that adopted at Eton. The teacher may sit in a punt or on\\\\r\\\\na rock, with a stout stick of 6 or 10 feet in length, at the end of which\\\\r\\\\nis a cord of 4 feet or so, with loops. The learner puts himself into the\\\\r\\\\nloops; and the teacher plays him, as a fisherman would play a fish, in\\\\r\\\\nwater that is well out of his depth: he gives him just enough support to\\\\r\\\\nkeep him from drowning. After six or a dozen lessons, many boys require\\\\r\\\\nno support at all, but swim about with the rope dangling slack about\\\\r\\\\nthem. When a boy does this, he can be left to shift for himself. The art\\\\r\\\\nof swimming far is acquired, like the art of running far, by a\\\\r\\\\ndetermination to go on, without resting a moment, until utterly unable to\\\\r\\\\nmake a stroke further, and then to stop altogether. Each succeeding day,\\\\r\\\\nthe distance travelled is marvellously increased, until the natural limit\\\\r\\\\nof the man's powers is attained. The chilliness consequent on staying\\\\r\\\\nlong in water is retarded by rubbing all over the body, before entering\\\\r\\\\nit, about twice as much oil or bear's-grease as a person uses for his\\\\r\\\\nhair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo support those who cannot Swim.--If a person cannot swim a stroke, he\\\\r\\\\nshould be buoyed up with floats under his arms, and lashed quite\\\\r\\\\nsecurely, to his own satisfaction; then he can be towed across the river\\\\r\\\\nwith a string. If he lose courage halfway, it cannot be helped: it will\\\\r\\\\ndo him no harm, and his swimming friend is in no danger of being grappled\\\\r\\\\nwith and drowned. For very short distances, a usual way is for the man\\\\r\\\\nwho cannot swim to hold his friend by the hips. A very little floating\\\\r\\\\npower is enough to buoy a man's head, above still water. (See \\\\\\\"African\\\\r\\\\nSwimming Ferry,\\\\\\\" below.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLanding through Breakers.--In landing through a heavy surf, wait for a\\\\r\\\\nlarge wave, and come in on the crest of it; then make every possible\\\\r\\\\nexertion to scramble up to some firm holding-place, whence its indraught,\\\\r\\\\nwhen it returns, can be resisted. If drawn back, you will be heavily\\\\r\\\\nbattered, perhaps maimed, certainly far more exhausted than before, and\\\\r\\\\nnot a whit nearer to safety. Avoid receiving a breaker in the attitude of\\\\r\\\\nscrambling away from it on hands and knees: from such a position, the\\\\r\\\\nwave projects a man headforemost with fearful force, and rolls him over\\\\r\\\\nand over in its surge. He ought to turn on his back the instant before\\\\r\\\\nthe breaker is upon him; and then all will go well, and he will be helped\\\\r\\\\non, and not half-killed by it. Men on shore can rescue a man who is being\\\\r\\\\nwashed to and fro in the surf, by holding together, very firmly,\\\\r\\\\nhand-in-hand, and forming a line down to the sea: the foremost man\\\\r\\\\nclutches the swimmer as soon as he is washed up to him, and holds him\\\\r\\\\nfirmly while the wave is retiring. The force of the indraught is\\\\r\\\\nenormous, and none but strong men can withstand it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFloats.--If a traveller can swim pretty well, it is a good plan to make a\\\\r\\\\nfloat when he wishes to cross a river, and to lay his breast upon it,\\\\r\\\\nwhile his clothes and valuables are enclosed in a huge turban on his\\\\r\\\\nhead. In this way, he may cross the broadest streams and float great\\\\r\\\\ndistances down a river. He may tie paddles to his hands. His float may\\\\r\\\\nconsist of a faggot of rushes, a log of wood, or any one of his empty\\\\r\\\\nwater-vessels, whether barrels or bags; for whatever will keep water in,\\\\r\\\\nwill also keep it out. The small quantity of air, which might escape\\\\r\\\\nthrough the sides of a bag, should be restored by blowing afresh into it,\\\\r\\\\nduring the voyage. A few yards of intestine blown out and tied here and\\\\r\\\\nthere, so as to form so many watertight compartments, makes a capital\\\\r\\\\nswimming belt: it may be wound in a figure of 8 round the neck and under\\\\r\\\\nthe armpits. When employing empty bottles, they should be well corked and\\\\r\\\\nmade fast under the armpits, or be stuffed within the shirt or jersey,\\\\r\\\\nand a belt tied round the waist below them, to keep them in place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfrican Swimming Ferry.--The people of Yariba have a singular mode of\\\\r\\\\ntransporting passengers across rivers and streams, when the violence and\\\\r\\\\nrapidity of their currents prevent them from using canoes with safety.\\\\r\\\\nThe passenger grasps the float (see fig.), on the top of which his\\\\r\\\\nluggage is lashed; and a perfect equilibrium is preserved, by the\\\\r\\\\nferry-man placing himself opposite the passenger, and laying hold of both\\\\r\\\\nhis arms. They being thus face to face, the owner of the float propels it\\\\r\\\\nby striking with his legs. The natives use as their float two of their\\\\r\\\\nlargest calabashes, cutting off their small ends, and joining the\\\\r\\\\nopenings face to face, so as to form a large, hollow, watertight vessel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of African swimming ferry].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMakeshift Life-belt.--A moderately effective life-belt may be made of\\\\r\\\\nholland, ticking, canvas, or similar materials, in the following manner,\\\\r\\\\nand might be used with advantage by the crew of a vessel aground some way\\\\r\\\\nfrom the mainland, who are about to swim for their lives:--Cut out two\\\\r\\\\ncomplete rings, of 16 inches outer diameter and 8 inches inner diameter;\\\\r\\\\nsew these together along both edges, with as fine a needle as possible\\\\r\\\\nand with double thread: add strong shoulder-straps, so that it shall not,\\\\r\\\\nby any possibility, slip down over the hips; and, lastly, sew into it a\\\\r\\\\nlong narrow tube, made out of a strip, a foot long and two inches wide,\\\\r\\\\nof the same material as the belt. At the mouth of this, a bit of wood, an\\\\r\\\\ninch long, with a hole bored down its middle, should be inserted as a\\\\r\\\\nmouthpiece. Through this tube the belt can be re-inflated by the swimmer\\\\r\\\\nwhile in the water, as often as may be necessary; and, by simply twisting\\\\r\\\\nthe tube and tucking its end in the belt, its vent can always be closed.\\\\r\\\\nAfter a canvas belt is thoroughly drenched, it will hold the air very\\\\r\\\\nfairly: the seams are its weakest parts. For supporting a swimmer in calm\\\\r\\\\nwater, a collar is as good as a belt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTransport on Water.--Parcels.--The swimmer's valuables may as well be put\\\\r\\\\ninside the empty vessel that acts as his float, as in the turban on his\\\\r\\\\nhead (see \\\\\\\"Floats\\\\\\\"). A goat-skin is often filled half full of the things\\\\r\\\\nhe wants to carry, and is then blown out and its mouth secured. A very\\\\r\\\\ngood life-belt may be bought, which admits of this arrangement: it has a\\\\r\\\\nlarge opening at one end, which is closed by a brass door that shuts like\\\\r\\\\nthe top of an inkstand, and is then quite air-tight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA small parcel, if tightly wrapped up in many folds, will keep dry for a\\\\r\\\\nlong time, though partly immersed in water: the outside of it may be\\\\r\\\\ngreased, oiled, or waxed, for additional security. If deeply immersed,\\\\r\\\\nthe water is sure to get in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSwimming with Horses.--In crossing a deep river, with a horse or other\\\\r\\\\nlarge animal, drive him in: or even lead him along a steep bank, and push\\\\r\\\\nhim sideways, suddenly into the water: having fairly started him, jump in\\\\r\\\\nyourself, seize his tail, and let him tow you across. If he turns his\\\\r\\\\nhead with the intention of changing his course, splash water in his face\\\\r\\\\nwith your right or left hand, as the case may be, holding the tail with\\\\r\\\\none hand and splashing with the other; and you will, in this way, direct\\\\r\\\\nhim just as you like. This is by far the best way of swimming a horse:\\\\r\\\\nall others are objectionable and even dangerous with animals new to the\\\\r\\\\nwork,--such as to swim alongside the horse, with one hand on his\\\\r\\\\nshoulder; or, worst of all, to retain your seat on his back. If this last\\\\r\\\\nmethod be persisted in, at least let the rider take his feet out of the\\\\r\\\\nstirrups, before entering the water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of horse and man crossing river].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo float a Wagon across a River.--It must be well ballasted, or it will\\\\r\\\\nassuredly capsize: the heavy contents should be stowed at the bottom; the\\\\r\\\\nplanking lashed to the axletrees, or it will float away from them; great\\\\r\\\\nbundles of reeds and the empty water-vessels should be made fast high\\\\r\\\\nabove all, and then the wagon will cross without danger. When it is\\\\r\\\\nfairly under weigh, the oxen will swim it across, pulling in their yokes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWater Spectacles.--When a man opens his eyes under water, he can see\\\\r\\\\nnothing distinctly; but everything is as much out of focus, as if he\\\\r\\\\nlooked, in air, through a pair of powerful spectacles that were utterly\\\\r\\\\nunsuited to him. He cannot distinguish the letters of the largest print\\\\r\\\\nin a newspaper advertisement; he cannot see the spaces between the\\\\r\\\\noutstretched fingers, at arm's length, in clear water; nor at a few\\\\r\\\\ninches' distance in water that is somewhat opaque. I read a short paper\\\\r\\\\non this subject, at the British Association in 1865, in which I showed\\\\r\\\\nthe precise cause of this imperfection of vision and how it might be\\\\r\\\\nremedied. If the front of our eyeballs had been flat, we should have had\\\\r\\\\nthe power of seeing under water as clearly as in air; but instead of\\\\r\\\\nbeing flat, they are very convex, consequently our eye stamps a concave\\\\r\\\\nlens of high power into the water, and it is the seeing through this\\\\r\\\\nconcave eyeglass which our eyeball makes for itself, that causes the\\\\r\\\\nindistinctness of our vision. Knowing the curvature of the eyeball, it is\\\\r\\\\neasy to calculate (as I did in the memoir mentioned above) the curvature\\\\r\\\\nof a convex lens of flint-glass that should, when plunged into water,\\\\r\\\\nproduce effects of an exactly equal and contrary value, exactly\\\\r\\\\nneutralizing the effects of the concave eyeglass of water, if it were\\\\r\\\\nheld immediately in front of the pupil of the eye. I have made several\\\\r\\\\nexperiments with a view to obtaining serviceable spectacles, for seeing\\\\r\\\\nunder water. The result is as follows:--experience has shown the distance\\\\r\\\\nfrom the eyeball at which spectacle-glasses can be most conveniently\\\\r\\\\nplaced; now at that distance, the joint effect of the concave water-lens\\\\r\\\\nand the convex glass spectacle-lens, is to produce an opera-glass of\\\\r\\\\nexceedingly low magnifying power, that requires a small adjustment for\\\\r\\\\naccurate definition at different distances.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf the spectacle-lens be of flint-glass and doubly convex, each of its\\\\r\\\\nfaces should have a curvature of not greater than 6 1/2 tenths of an\\\\r\\\\ninch, nor more than 8 1/2 tenths of an inch in radius: within these\\\\r\\\\nlimits, it is practicable to obtain perfectly distinct vision under water\\\\r\\\\nby pressing the spectacles forwards or backwards to a moderate degree.\\\\r\\\\nLenses of these high magnifying powers are sometimes sold by\\\\r\\\\nspectacle-makers, for persons who have undergone an operation for\\\\r\\\\ncataract. I have tried, but hitherto without much success, to arrange the\\\\r\\\\nfittings by which the lenses are secured so that by a movement of the jaw\\\\r\\\\nor by an elevation of the eyebrows, I could give the necessary adjustment\\\\r\\\\nof the glasses, leaving my hands free for the purpose of swimming. (See\\\\r\\\\nalso, under \\\\\\\"Fishing;' 'To see Things deep under Water.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRAFTS AND BOATS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRafts.--Rafts of Wood.--Rafts are made of logs of wood, held together by\\\\r\\\\npairs of cross-bars, one of each pair lying above the raft and the other\\\\r\\\\nbelow; then, the whole may be made quite firm by a little judicious\\\\r\\\\nnotching wherethe logs cross, and a few pegs and lashings. Briers,\\\\r\\\\nwoodbines, etc., will do for these. If the logs are large, they should be\\\\r\\\\nseparately launched into the river, and towed into their proper places.\\\\r\\\\nOutriggers vastly increase the stability of a raft. The raft-fastening in\\\\r\\\\ncommon use is shown in f. 1: it is a stout, little wand, bent over the\\\\r\\\\ncross piece, and wedged into holes in the framework.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of raft].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig 2 show fastening arrangements].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe rafts of European rivers are usually built on shore, and launched\\\\r\\\\ninto the water: three slides are laid for the purpose, on the sloping\\\\r\\\\nbank of the river; upon these are laid the four poles, secured together\\\\r\\\\nby their ends, which are to form the framework of the raft (fig. 2).\\\\r\\\\nOther poles are put in between, until the whole is complete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBamboo rafts.--Where bamboo is plentiful, it is preferable to any other\\\\r\\\\nmaterial for rafts. A few bamboos lashed into the shape of an ordinary\\\\r\\\\nfield gate, but with two diagonals, and with handfuls of grass thrown on\\\\r\\\\nto make a platform, is very buoyant and serviceable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFloating power of various Woods.--The floating power of a raft depends on\\\\r\\\\nthe buoyancy of the wood of which it is made. I give, in a Table (p. 90),\\\\r\\\\na list of the specific gravities of a few well-known woods; and have\\\\r\\\\nannexed to them a column of what may be called their \\\\\\\"specific floating\\\\r\\\\npowers.\\\\\\\"*\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Footnote] *Specific floating power = (1/Spec. Gr.)--1. (Mem., the Table\\\\r\\\\nof these, in previous editions is incorrect.) Burden = weight of raft x\\\\r\\\\nspecific floating power. Weight of wood required to support a given burden =\\\\r\\\\nBurden x (Spec. Gr./1-Spec. Gr.); the last column gives the latter\\\\r\\\\nfactor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHence, to find the actual floating power of a raft, it is simply\\\\r\\\\nnecessary to multiply its weight into the specific floating power of the\\\\r\\\\nwood of which it is made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThus, a raft of 12 logs of larch, averaging 30 lbs. each, weighs 360\\\\r\\\\nlbs.; this multiplied by .47, is equal to 169 lbs. very nearly, which is\\\\r\\\\nthe weight the raft will support without sinking. Poplar is the lightest\\\\r\\\\non the list.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n              Specific          Specific      Factors to be multiplied\\\\r\\\\n             Gravities.

When felled, their tops and branches, also, are\\\\r\\\\nto be trimmed by fire. (See \\\\\\\"Hutting Palisades.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReed Rafts.--Mr. Andersson, in exploring the Tioughe River, in South\\\\r\\\\nAfrica, met with two very simple forms of rafts: the one was a vast\\\\r\\\\nquantity of reeds cut down, heaped into a stack of from 30 to 50 feet in\\\\r\\\\ndiameter, pushed out into the water, and allowed to float down stream:\\\\r\\\\neach day, as the reeds became water-logged, more were cut and thrown on\\\\r\\\\nthe stack: its great bulk made it sure of passing over shallow places;\\\\r\\\\nand when it struck against \\\\\\\"snags,\\\\\\\" the force of the water soon slewed it\\\\r\\\\nround and started it afresh. On an affair of this description, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nAndersson, with seven attendants, and two canoes hauled up upon it,\\\\r\\\\ndescended the river for five days. The second reed raft was a small and\\\\r\\\\nneat one, and used for ferries; it was a mattress of reeds, 5 feet long,\\\\r\\\\n3 broad, and some 8 inches thick, tied together with strips of the reeds\\\\r\\\\nthemselves; to each of its four corners was fixed a post, made of an\\\\r\\\\nupright faggot of reeds, 18 inches high; other faggots connected the tops\\\\r\\\\nof the posts horizontally, in the place of rails: this was all; it held\\\\r\\\\none or two men, and nothing but reeds or rushes were used in its\\\\r\\\\nconstruction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRafts of distended Hides.--\\\\\\\"A single ox-hide may be made into a float\\\\r\\\\ncapable of sustaining about 300 lbs.; the skin is to be cut to the\\\\r\\\\nlargest possible circle, then gathered together round a short tube, to\\\\r\\\\nthe inner end of which a valve, like that of a common pair of bellows,\\\\r\\\\nhas been applied; it is inflated with bellows, and, as the air escapes by\\\\r\\\\ndegrees, it may be refilled every ten or twelve hours.\\\\\\\" ('Handbook for\\\\r\\\\nField Service.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe read of the skins of animals, stuffed with hay to keep them distended,\\\\r\\\\nhaving been used by Alexander the Great, and by others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGoatskin rafts are extensively used on the Tigris and elsewhere. These\\\\r\\\\nare inflated through one of the legs: they are generally lashed to a\\\\r\\\\nframework of wood, branches, and reeds, in such a way that the leg is\\\\r\\\\naccessible to a person sitting on the raft: when the air has in part\\\\r\\\\nescaped, he creeps round to the skins, one after the other, untying and\\\\r\\\\nre-inflating them in succession.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch fig. 1 and fig. 2 showing gourd rafts].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfrican Gourd Raft.--Over a large part of Bornu, especially on its\\\\r\\\\nKomadugu--the so-called River Yeou of Central Africa--no boat is used,\\\\r\\\\nexcept the following ingenious contrivance. It is called a \\\\\\\"makara,\\\\\\\" or\\\\r\\\\nboat pareminence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTwo large open gourds are nicely balanced, and fixed, bottom downwards,\\\\r\\\\non a bar or yoke of light wood, 4 feet long, 4 1/2 inches wide, and 3/4\\\\r\\\\nor 1 inch thick. The fisherman, or traveller, packs his gear into the\\\\r\\\\ngourds; launches the makara into the river, and seats himself astride the\\\\r\\\\nbar. He then paddles off, with help of his hands (fig. 1). When he leaves\\\\r\\\\nthe river, he carries the makara on his back (fig. 2). The late Dr. Barth\\\\r\\\\nwrote to me, \\\\\\\"A person accustomed to such sort of voyage, sits very\\\\r\\\\ncomfortably; a stranger holds on to one of the calabashes. There is no\\\\r\\\\nfear of capsizing, as the calabashes go under water, according to the\\\\r\\\\nweight put upon them, from ten to sixteen inches. The yoke is firmly\\\\r\\\\nfastened to the two calabashes, for it is never taken off. I am scarcely\\\\r\\\\nable, at present, to say how it is fastened. As far as I remember, it is\\\\r\\\\nfixed by a very firm lashing, which forms a sort of network over the\\\\r\\\\ncalabash, and at the same time serves to strengthen the latter and guard\\\\r\\\\nit against an accident.\\\\\\\" It is obvious that the gourds might be replaced\\\\r\\\\nby inflated bags or baskets, covered with leather, or by copper or tin\\\\r\\\\nvessels, or by any other equivalent. I quite agree with Dr. Barth, that a\\\\r\\\\nmakara would be particularly suitable for a traveller. In Bornu, they\\\\r\\\\nmake large rafts, by putting a frame over several of these makara, placed\\\\r\\\\nside by side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of sailing boat].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRude Boats.--Brazilian Sailing-boat.--A simpler sailing-boat or raft\\\\r\\\\ncould hardly be imagined than that shown in the figure; it is used by\\\\r\\\\nfishermen in Brazil.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLog Canoes are made by hollowing out a long tree by axe and by fire, and\\\\r\\\\nfastening an outrigger to one side of it, to give steadiness in the\\\\r\\\\nwater. Recollect Robinson Crusoe's difficulty in launching his canoe\\\\r\\\\nafter he had made it. (See \\\\\\\"Rafts of Wood.\\\\\\\") It is not a difficult,\\\\r\\\\nthough a tedious operation, to burn out hollows in wood; the fire is\\\\r\\\\nconfined by wet earth, that it may not extend too far to either side, and\\\\r\\\\nthe charred matter is from time to time scraped away, and fresh fire\\\\r\\\\nraked back on the newly-exposed surface. A lazy savage sill be months in\\\\r\\\\nmaking a single canoe in this way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and fig 2 sketch of boat and pattern].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCanoe of Three Planks.--A swift, safe, and graceful little boat, with a\\\\r\\\\nsharp stem and stern, and with a bottom that curves upwards at both ends,\\\\r\\\\ncan be made out of three planks. The sketch, fig. 1, is a foreshortened\\\\r\\\\nview of the boat, and the diagram, fig. 2, shows the shape of the planks\\\\r\\\\nfrom which it is made. The thwart or seat shown in fig. 1 is important in\\\\r\\\\ngiving the proper inclination to the sides of the boat, for, without it,\\\\r\\\\nthey would tend to collapse; and the bottom would be less curved at\\\\r\\\\neither end. If the reader will take the trouble to trace fig. 2 on a\\\\r\\\\nstout card, to cut it out in a single piece (cutting only half through\\\\r\\\\nthe cardboard where the planks touch), and to fasten it into shape with\\\\r\\\\npieces of gummed paper, he will understand the architecture of the boat\\\\r\\\\nmore easily than from any description. If he wishes to build a boat he\\\\r\\\\nhad best proceed to make as large a model in pasteboard as his materials\\\\r\\\\nadmit, and to cut the planks to scale, according to the pattern of his\\\\r\\\\nmodel. The grace of the boat depends on the cut of its planks, just as\\\\r\\\\nmuch as the elegance of a dress does on that of its cloth. These\\\\r\\\\nthree-plank canoes are in frequent use in Norway. Bark may be used\\\\r\\\\ninstead of planks. If the canoe be built of five planks instead of three,\\\\r\\\\na second narrow side-plank being added above each gunwale, the section of\\\\r\\\\nthe canoe is decidedly improved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInflatable India-rubber Boats are an invention that has proved invaluable\\\\r\\\\nto travellers: they have been used in all quarters of the globe, and are\\\\r\\\\nfound to stand every climate. A full-sized one weighs only 40 lbs. They\\\\r\\\\nhave done especial service in Arctic exploration; the waters of the Great\\\\r\\\\nSalt Lake, in the Mormon country, were first explored and navigated with\\\\r\\\\none by Fremont; they were also employed by Dr. Livingstone on the rivers\\\\r\\\\nof South Africa. They stand a wonderful amount of wear and tear; but, as\\\\r\\\\nboats, they are inferior to native canoes, as they are very slow in the\\\\r\\\\nwater: it is, indeed, impossible to paddle them against a moderate\\\\r\\\\nhead-wind. For the general purposes of travellers, I should be inclined\\\\r\\\\nto recommend as small a macintosh-boat as can be constructed; just\\\\r\\\\nsufficient for one, or at the most for two, persons; such as the cloaks\\\\r\\\\nthat are made inflatable, and convertible into boats. A traveller wants a\\\\r\\\\nportable boat, chiefly as means to cross over to a village for help, or\\\\r\\\\nto carry his valuables across a river, while the heavy things are risked\\\\r\\\\nat a ford; or for shooting, fishing, or surveying. Now a very small boat,\\\\r\\\\nweighing about ten pounds, would do as well for all these purposes as a\\\\r\\\\nlarge one, and would be far more portable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is perfectly easy to get into a macintosh-boat, after having been\\\\r\\\\ncapsized out of it into deep water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBasket-boat with Canvas Sides.--FitzRoy gives an account of a party of\\\\r\\\\nhis sailors, whose boat had been stolen while they were encamped, putting\\\\r\\\\nout to sea in a large basket, woven with such boughs as were at hand, and\\\\r\\\\ncovered with their canvas tent--the inside of which they had puddled with\\\\r\\\\nclay, to keep the water from oozing through too fast. They were eighteen\\\\r\\\\nhours afloat in this crazy craft. I mention this instance, to show how\\\\r\\\\nalmost anything will make a boat. Canvas saturated with grease or oil is\\\\r\\\\nwaterproof, and painted canvas is at first an excellent covering for a\\\\r\\\\nboat, but it soon becomes rotten.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCanoe of Reeds or Vegetable Fibre.--A canoe may be made of reeds, rushes,\\\\r\\\\nor the light inner bark of trees. Either of these materials is bound into\\\\r\\\\nthree long faggots, pointed at one end: these are placed side by side and\\\\r\\\\nlashed together, and the result is a serviceable vessel, of the\\\\r\\\\nappearance fig. 1, and section as fig. 2. The Lake Titicaca, which lies\\\\r\\\\nfar above the limit of trees, is navigated by boats made of rushes, and\\\\r\\\\ncarrying sails woven of rushes also. Little boats are sometimes made of\\\\r\\\\ntwigs, and are then plastered both inside and outside with clay, but they\\\\r\\\\nare very leaky.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and fig 2--sketches of reed canoe].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHide Tray.--This is a good contrivance; and if the hide be smoked (see\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Hides\\\\\\\") after it is set, it is vastly improved. In its simplest form,\\\\r\\\\nPeruvian travellers describe it as a dish or tray, consisting of a dry\\\\r\\\\nhide pinched up at the four corners, and each corner secured with a\\\\r\\\\nthorn. The preferable plan is to make eyelet-holes round its rim, and\\\\r\\\\npass a thong through, drawing it pretty close: the tray is kept in shape,\\\\r\\\\nby sticks put inside and athwart its bottom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCoracle and Skin Punt.--If a traveller has one hide only at his disposal\\\\r\\\\nhe should make a coracle, if he has two, a punt. This last is a really\\\\r\\\\nuseful boat; one in which very great distances of river may be descended\\\\r\\\\nwith safety, and much luggage taken. Hide boats are very light, since the\\\\r\\\\nweight of a bullock's skin only averages 45 lbs.; but, unless well\\\\r\\\\ngreased, they soon rot. When taken out of the water, they should be laid\\\\r\\\\nbottom upwards to dry. To make a proper and substantial coracle, a dozen\\\\r\\\\nor more oxier or other wands must be cut; these are to be bent, and have\\\\r\\\\nboth ends stuck in the ground, in such a way as to form the framework of\\\\r\\\\nthe required boat, bottom upwards, much like half a walnut-shell in\\\\r\\\\nshape, but flatter. Where these wands cross, they should be lashed; and\\\\r\\\\nsticks should be wattled in, to fill up gaps. A raw hide is then thrown\\\\r\\\\nover the framework, sewn in place, and left to dry. Finally, the\\\\r\\\\nprojecting ends of the osiers have to be cut off. Should this boat, by\\\\r\\\\nany chance, prove a failure, the hide is not wasted, but can be removed,\\\\r\\\\nsoaked till soft, and used again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA skin punt requires two bullocks' or other hides, and also about ten\\\\r\\\\nsmall willow-trees, or other tough flexible wood, 14 feet long. Captain\\\\r\\\\nPalliser says that a couple of days is sufficient for two people to\\\\r\\\\ncomplete an entire punt of this description. He has been so good as to\\\\r\\\\nfurnish me with the following minute description of the way of making\\\\r\\\\nthis very useful boat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1. The keel, stem and stern might be in one; but because the stem and\\\\r\\\\nstern ought to be strong, this whole line is made of two small trees\\\\r\\\\nlashed together with the thick ends outwards, as in fig. 1, where AB is a\\\\r\\\\nlithe clean little willow-tree, and ab another similar one. They are\\\\r\\\\nlashed together at their taper ends.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n2. Cut notches half-way through KK, at about 20 to 25 inches from each\\\\r\\\\nend; then turn up the notched portions, and you have stem, keel and\\\\r\\\\nstern, all in one piece, as in fig. 2.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig 2 sketches].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n3. Stake out the ground, according to the size your boat will cover, by\\\\r\\\\ndriving eight strong pointed stakes of wood into the ground; to these\\\\r\\\\nlash four cross (willow-tree) sticks, notched in two places, so that each\\\\r\\\\nof these four willows shall form two knees, as well as run across the\\\\r\\\\nbottom of the boat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n4. Bent two more main willows for gunwales for the boat, and two more for\\\\r\\\\nbottom rails. Each separate stick, as will be perceived by fig. 3, is\\\\r\\\\nlashed in five different places, and the keep in eight places.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 3 and Fig 4--sketches as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe main framework being now completed, loosen it from the stakes driven\\\\r\\\\ninto the ground.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n5. Fasten a large number of little slender willow-twigs between each of\\\\r\\\\nthe main cross-knees, as shown by the thin lines in fig. 3. It is then\\\\r\\\\nfit for covering. Lift it up like a basket, and turn it topsy-turvy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n6. Kill two bulls, skin them, and in skinning be careful to make your\\\\r\\\\ncuts in the skin down the rump to the hock of the animal, and down the\\\\r\\\\nbrisket in front of the fore-leg to the knee, so as to have your skins as\\\\r\\\\nsquare as possible (fig. 4). Cut off the heads, and sew the skins\\\\r\\\\ntogether at the nape of the necks; and, while reeking, cover the\\\\r\\\\nwicker-work, turning them over it, the hairy side inwards, and fasten it\\\\r\\\\nall round by means of skin-cords. Cut holes with a knife round the edges,\\\\r\\\\nto pass the cords through, as you lash up to the top-rails of the boat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n7. Leave it 24 hours in the sun; cover the seam where the skins are sewn\\\\r\\\\ntogether, with melted fat, and the boat is fit for use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBark Boats.--\\\\\\\"From a pine, or other tree, take off with care the longest\\\\r\\\\npossible entire portion of the bark; while fresh and flexible, spread it\\\\r\\\\nflat as a long rectangular sheet; then turn it carefully up at the sides,\\\\r\\\\nthe smooth side outwards; sew the ends together, and caulk them well. A\\\\r\\\\nfew cross-sticks for thwarts complete this contrivance, which is made by\\\\r\\\\nan American Indian in a few hours, and in which the rapid waters of the\\\\r\\\\nMackenzie are navigated for hundreds of miles. Ways of strengthening the\\\\r\\\\nstructure will readily suggest themselves. The native material for sewing\\\\r\\\\nis the fibrous root of the pine.\\\\\\\" (\\\\\\\"Handbook for Field Service,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nLieut.-Col. Lefroy.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Figs I, II, III, and IV--sketches as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBirch-bark canoes.--Birch bark, as is well known, is used for building\\\\r\\\\ncanoes in North America, and the bark of many other trees would do for\\\\r\\\\ncovering the framework of a boat, in default of leather. But it is\\\\r\\\\nuseless to give a detailed account of birch canoes, as great skill and\\\\r\\\\nneat execution are required both in making and in using them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoats of Sheet-tin, covered with Pitched Canvas.--These might be made at\\\\r\\\\nany of the outposts of civilization. I am indebted to a correspondent,\\\\r\\\\nwhose name I regret exceedingly to be unable to insert, having\\\\r\\\\nunfortunately mislaid it, for the following full description of his\\\\r\\\\nshooting-punt. It will be obvious that his methods are applicable not\\\\r\\\\nonly to their professed object, but also to tin boats of any shape\\\\r\\\\nwhatever.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Form the bottom, fig. I., as follows:--Select the thickest sheets of tin\\\\r\\\\nand solder them together by their narrowest sides, until as many lengths\\\\r\\\\nare made as, when laid side by side, will be sufficient for the whole\\\\r\\\\nlength and breadth of the figure. The soldering should be by a joint of\\\\r\\\\nthis kind.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of join].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"These lengths must then be soldered side by side by a similar joint, and\\\\r\\\\nthe whole sheet thus made, trimmed to the shape of fig. I., care being\\\\r\\\\ntaken that no two joints in the lengths should be exactly opposite each\\\\r\\\\nother. Form two other sheets in a similar manner for the two sides, and\\\\r\\\\nof the shape of fig. II. The dotted lines a b c d e f, fig. I., show the\\\\r\\\\nportions of the tin round the edges, 1 inch wide, which must be turned up\\\\r\\\\nat right angles with the bottom, and to which the sides are to be\\\\r\\\\nsoldered on the inside; they should have triangular pieces clipped out of\\\\r\\\\nthem, as shown in the fig., where the bends of the boat begin, to make\\\\r\\\\nthem take the curve required. The two extra pieces at the ends a d, e f,\\\\r\\\\n2 inches wide, are for turning down over an iron rod, which is to pass\\\\r\\\\nround the gunwale, to give stiffness to the boat; g h, fig. II., is a\\\\r\\\\nbreadth of 2 inches of extra tin, for the same purpose of turning down\\\\r\\\\nover the iron rod.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Each side is now to be soldered to the bottom piece, beginning with the\\\\r\\\\ncentre, and working in to each end.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The soldering of the turned-up edges to the bottom, on the outside, may\\\\r\\\\nthen be done. Separate slips of tin 2 inches wide should then be bent up\\\\r\\\\nlongitudinally in halves, like angle-iron, and fitted along the joining\\\\r\\\\nof the bottom and sides, on the inside, and soldered; these slips may\\\\r\\\\nalso be clipped on either side, when necessary, to make them take the\\\\r\\\\ncurves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The measure round the gunwale may now be taken within the edge of the\\\\r\\\\ntin, and an iron rod 3/8 of an inch thick, to go round this gunwale, bent\\\\r\\\\nto the form of the outline of fig. III., i b k c, which will now be that\\\\r\\\\nof the boat, and the ends welded at their meeting. Sufficient iron rod\\\\r\\\\nmust be taken to form eyes at i and k to receive rings of 3 or 4 inches\\\\r\\\\ndiameter, through which a pole is to be passed, for carrying the boat,\\\\r\\\\nand for their welding at the meeting of the ends.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The iron-rod gunwale may now be put in, and the 2 inches width of tin,\\\\r\\\\nallowed in excess on the sides and ends of the bottom, turned down\\\\r\\\\nclosely over the rod, all round and soldered on the inside. The side\\\\r\\\\nelevation of the boat will now be as w x y, fig. IV. \\\\\\\"The boat should be\\\\r\\\\nproved as to being water-tight by filling it with water, any leak being\\\\r\\\\nstopped by more solder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The outside must now be covered with pitched canvas, thus:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Turn it upside down, in a sheltered spot exposed to the sun, or warm it\\\\r\\\\nby other means, and have a caldron of boiling pitch on a fire at hand,\\\\r\\\\nalso have sufficient canvas sewn together in breadths as will quite cover\\\\r\\\\nthe boat, bottom and sides; then, beginning across the middle of the\\\\r\\\\nbottom, brush on a layer 3 or 4 inches wide of the boiling pitch, and\\\\r\\\\nquickly press down the corresponding central portion of the canvas upon\\\\r\\\\nit; work on thus, from the centre of the bottom to the ends, laying on a\\\\r\\\\nbreadth of pitch, and then pressing down and stretching a portion of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas over it; then turn down the canvas over each side, and pitch in\\\\r\\\\nthe same way, butting out the parts of the canvas that would overlap too\\\\r\\\\nmuch at the bends, but leaving no tin uncovered; the boat may then be\\\\r\\\\nrighted, the excess of canvas cut off, and the edge laid down with pitch,\\\\r\\\\na little short of the gunwale.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The bottom may then be pitched over the canvas for 6 inches up, and the\\\\r\\\\nrest of the outside, with the inside, be painted with two or three coats.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"A flooring of thin planking for 3 1/2 feet of the central portion of the\\\\r\\\\nboat must now be made as follows:--Make five planks, between 8 and 9\\\\r\\\\ninches wide, to fit across the beam of the boat, and in each of the outer\\\\r\\\\nplanks, o o, p p, fig. III., fix uprights m n, 6 inches high, to support\\\\r\\\\na seat, mortised on the pair of uprights in each board; the ends of each\\\\r\\\\nseat should be short of the breadth of the boat by an inch or so, so as\\\\r\\\\nnot to bear against the sides; then lay down two ribs of tough wood,\\\\r\\\\nfitted to bear equally across the planking, on each side, as rs, r1 s1,\\\\r\\\\nand screw each end of them down to the outer planks only.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Wooden cleats can be fixed on each board at t t, each to receive the\\\\r\\\\nbutts of two guns, while their barrels lie in hollows formed in the\\\\r\\\\ncushions of the seat opposite them, so that the rower can put down his\\\\r\\\\npaddles and take up his gun instantly; steps for a mast can be also\\\\r\\\\ncontrived at the same points. The woodwork is to be also well painted; it\\\\r\\\\ncan be taken out with ease, as it is nowhere connected with the tin of\\\\r\\\\nthe boat. Care should be taken that no projections in this woodwork, such\\\\r\\\\nas screw-heads, etc., should chafe the tin, and that it should be always\\\\r\\\\nkept well painted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The boat, of which this is a description, drew 2 1/2 inches water with\\\\r\\\\none person in, with two guns and ammunition, etc.; it was furnished with\\\\r\\\\ntwo short paddles, which were tied by a short length of string to the\\\\r\\\\nsides, so as to be dropped without loss of time on taking up the gun to\\\\r\\\\nfire; the boat turned with the greatest ease, by one backing and pulling\\\\r\\\\nstroke of the two paddles, and was very stiff in the water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Iron rowlocks were fitted to it, on the outside at b, e, fig. I. (I do\\\\r\\\\nnot give the diagram by which the author illustrated his description; the\\\\r\\\\nrowlocks were applied to the sides of the boat, and each rowlock was\\\\r\\\\nsecured to the side by three bolts.) The two upper bolts had claw-heads\\\\r\\\\nto seize the iron-rod gunwale on the inside, and a piece of wood was\\\\r\\\\nfitted on the inside, through which the three bolts passed, to give\\\\r\\\\nsubstance for their hold, their nuts were on the outside. With these\\\\r\\\\nrowlocks two oars of 7 feet long were used. The breadth between the horns\\\\r\\\\nshould be only just enough to admit the oars.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"This boat could be carried on the shoulders of two persons, when\\\\r\\\\nsuspended on a pole passed through the end rings, for a distance of\\\\r\\\\ntwelve or fifteen miles daily, with guns and ammunition stowed in it. It\\\\r\\\\ncould be fired from, standing, without risk, and be poled over marshy\\\\r\\\\nground barely covered with water, or dragged with ease by the person\\\\r\\\\nseated in it, through high reeds, by grasping a handful on each side and\\\\r\\\\nhauling on them. A rudder was unnecessary. It was in use for more than\\\\r\\\\nthree years, and with due care in getting in and out, on a rough shore,\\\\r\\\\nand by keeping it well painted and pitched, it never leaked or became\\\\r\\\\nimpaired in any way.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoats.--Of Wood.--English-made boats have been carried by explorers for\\\\r\\\\ngreat distances on wheels, but seldom seem to have done much useful\\\\r\\\\nservice. They would travel easiest if slung and made fast in a strong\\\\r\\\\nwooden crate or framework, to be fixed on the body of the carriage. A\\\\r\\\\nwhite covering is necessary for a wooden boat, on account of the sun:\\\\r\\\\nboth boat and covering should be frequently examined. Mr. Richardson and\\\\r\\\\nhis party took a boat, divided in four quarters, on camel-back across the\\\\r\\\\nSahara, all the way from the Mediterranean to Lake Tchad. A portable\\\\r\\\\nframework of metal tubes, to be covered with india-rubber sheeting on\\\\r\\\\narrival, was suggested to me by a very competent authority, the late Mr.\\\\r\\\\nM'Gregor Laird.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCopper boats have been much recommended, because an accidental dent,\\\\r\\\\nhowever severe it may be, can be beaten back again without doing injury\\\\r\\\\nto the metal. One of the boats in Mr. Lynch's expedition down the Jordan\\\\r\\\\nwas made of copper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCorrugated Iron makes excellent boats for travellers; they are stamped by\\\\r\\\\nmachinery: Burton took one of them to Zanzibar. They were widely\\\\r\\\\nadvertised some ten years ago, but they never came into general use, and\\\\r\\\\nI do not know where they can now be procured.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCanoes.--The earlier exploits of the 'Rob Roy' canoe justly attracted\\\\r\\\\nmuch attention, and numerous canoe voyages have subsequently been made.\\\\r\\\\nThe Canoe Club is now a considerable institution, many of whose members\\\\r\\\\nmake yearly improvements in the designs of their crafts. Although canoes\\\\r\\\\nare delicately built and apparently fragile, experience has amply proved\\\\r\\\\nthat they can stand an extraordinary amount of hard usage in the hands of\\\\r\\\\ncareful travellers. As a general rule, it is by no means the heaviest and\\\\r\\\\nmost solid things that endure the best. If a lightly-made apparatus can\\\\r\\\\nbe secured from the risk of heavy things falling upon it, it will outlast\\\\r\\\\na heavy apparatus that shakes to pieces under the jar of its own weight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA hole cut in the square sail enables the voyager to see ahead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo carry on Horseback.--Mr. Macgregor, when in Syria, took two strong\\\\r\\\\npoles, each 16 feet long, and about 3 inches thick at the larger end.\\\\r\\\\nThese were placed on the ground 2 feet apart, and across them, at 3 feet\\\\r\\\\nfrom each end, he lashed two stout staves, about 4 feet long. Then a\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"leading\\\\\\\" horse was selected, that is, one used to lead caravans, and on\\\\r\\\\nhis back a large bag of straw was well girthed and flattened down. The\\\\r\\\\nframe was firmly tied on this, and the canoe, wrapped in carpets, was\\\\r\\\\nplaced on the frame. This simple method was used for three months over\\\\r\\\\nsand and snow, rock and jungle, mud and marsh--anywhere indeed that a\\\\r\\\\nhorse could go. The frame was elevated in front, so as to allow the\\\\r\\\\nhorse's head some room under the boat's keel. Two girth-straps kept the\\\\r\\\\ncanoe firmly in position above, and carpets were used as cushions under\\\\r\\\\nits bilge. A boy led the horse, and a strong man was told off to hold\\\\r\\\\nfast to the canoe in every difficulty. It will be seen, that in the event\\\\r\\\\nof a fall, the corners of the framework would receive the shock, not the\\\\r\\\\ncanoe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoating Gear.--Anchors may be made of wood weighted with stones. Fig. 1\\\\r\\\\nshows the anchor used by Brazilian fishermen with their rude boat or\\\\r\\\\nsailing-raft already described. Fig. 2 shows another sort of anchor that\\\\r\\\\nis in common use in Norway.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMast.--Where there is difficulty in \\\\\\\"stepping\\\\\\\" a mast, use a bar across\\\\r\\\\nthe thwarts and two poles, one lashed at either end of it, and coming\\\\r\\\\ntogether to a point above. This triangle takes the place of shrouds fore\\\\r\\\\nand aft. It is a very convenient rig for a boat with an outrigger: the\\\\r\\\\nSooloo pirates use it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 2--sketch of anchor].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOutrigger Irons.--Mr. Gilby informs me that he has travelled with a pair\\\\r\\\\nof light sculls and outrigger irons, which he was able to adapt to many\\\\r\\\\nkinds of rude boats. He found them of much service in Egypt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKeels are troublesome to make: lee-boards are effective substitutes, and\\\\r\\\\nare easily added to a rude boat or punt when it is desired to rig her as\\\\r\\\\na sailing-craft.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRudder.--A rude oar makes the most powerful, though not the most\\\\r\\\\nconvenient rudder. In the lakes of North Italy, where the winds are\\\\r\\\\nsteady, the heavy boats have a bar upon which the tiller of the rudder\\\\r\\\\nrests: this bar is full of small notches; and the bottom of the tiller,\\\\r\\\\nat the place where it rests on the bar, is furnished with a blunt\\\\r\\\\nknife-edge; the tiller is not stiffly joined to the rudder, but admits of\\\\r\\\\na little play up and down. When the boatman finds that the boat steers\\\\r\\\\nsteadily, he simply drops the tiller, which forthwith falls into the\\\\r\\\\nnotch below it, where it is held tight until the steersman cares to take\\\\r\\\\nthe tiller into his hand again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuoys.--An excellent buoy to mark out a passage is simply a small pole\\\\r\\\\nanchored by a rope at the end. It is very readily seen, and exposes so\\\\r\\\\nlittle surface to the wind and water, that it is not easily washed away.\\\\r\\\\nA pole of the thickness of a walking-stick is much used in Sweden. Such a\\\\r\\\\nbuoy costs only a rope, a stick, and a stone. A tuft of the\\\\r\\\\nsmall-branches may be left on the top of the pole.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLog.--For a log use a conical canvas bag thus--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of bag in two positions].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen the peg is drawn out by the usual jerk, the bag no longer presents\\\\r\\\\nits mouth to the water, but is easily drawn in by the line attached to\\\\r\\\\nits point.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoat Building.--Caulking.--Almost anything that is fibrous does for\\\\r\\\\ncaulking the seams of a boat. The inner bark of trees is one of the\\\\r\\\\nreadiest materials.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSecuring Planks.--In default of nails, it is possible to drill or to\\\\r\\\\nburn holes in the planks and to sew them together with strips of hide,\\\\r\\\\nwoodbine, or string made from the inner bark of fibrous trees. Holes may\\\\r\\\\nbe drilled on precisely the same principle as that which I have described\\\\r\\\\nin making fire by friction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLengthening Boats.--If you have an ordinary boat, and wish to make it of\\\\r\\\\ngreater burden, saw it in half and lengthen it. Comparatively coarse\\\\r\\\\ncarpentering is good enough for this purpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoat Management.--Hauling boats on Shore.--To haul up a boat on a\\\\r\\\\nbarren shore, with but a few hands, lay out the anchor ahead of her to\\\\r\\\\nmake fast your purchase to; or back the body of a wagon underneath the\\\\r\\\\nboat as she floats, and so draw her out upon wheels. A make-shift\\\\r\\\\nframework, on small solid wheels, has been used and recommended.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTowing.--A good way of fastening a tow-rope to a boat that has no mast\\\\r\\\\nis shown in the diagram, which, however, is very coarsely drawn. A curved\\\\r\\\\npole is lashed alongside one of the knees of the boat, and the tow-rope,\\\\r\\\\npassing with a turn or two round its end, is carried on to the stern of\\\\r\\\\nthe boat. By taking a few turns, more or less, with the rope round the\\\\r\\\\nstick, the line of action of the tow-rope on the boat's axis may be\\\\r\\\\nproperly adjusted. When all is right the boat ought to steer herself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of boat being towed].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen Caught by a Gale recollect that a boat will lie-to and live through\\\\r\\\\nalmost any weather, if you can make a bundle of a few spare spars, oars,\\\\r\\\\netc., and secure them to the boat's head, so as to float in front of and\\\\r\\\\nacross the bow. They will act very sensibly as a breakwater, and will\\\\r\\\\nalways keep the boat's head towards the wind. Kroomen rig out three oars\\\\r\\\\nin a triangle, lash the boat's sail to it, throw overboard, after making\\\\r\\\\nfast, and pay out as much line as they can muster. By making a canvas\\\\r\\\\nhalf-deck to an open boat, you much increase its safety in broken water;\\\\r\\\\nand if it be made to lace down the centre, it can be rolled up on the\\\\r\\\\ngunwale, and be out of the way in fine weather.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn Floating down a Stream when the wind blows right against you (and on\\\\r\\\\nrivers the wind nearly always blows right up or right down), a plan\\\\r\\\\ngenerally employed is to cut large branches, to make them fast to the\\\\r\\\\nfront of the boat, weight them that they may sink low in the water, and\\\\r\\\\nthrow them overboard. The force of the stream acting on these branches\\\\r\\\\nwill more than counterbalance that of the wind upon the boat. For want of\\\\r\\\\nbranches, a kind of water-sail is sometimes made of canvas.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSteering in the Dark.--In dark nights, when on a river running through\\\\r\\\\npine forests, the mid stream canbe kept by occasionally striking the\\\\r\\\\nwater sharply with the blade of the oar, and listening to the echoes.\\\\r\\\\nThey should reach the ear simultaneously, or nearly so, from either bank.\\\\r\\\\nOn the same principle, vessels have been steered out of danger when\\\\r\\\\ncaught by a dense fog close to a rocky coast.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAwning.--The best is a wagon-roof awning, made simply of a couple of\\\\r\\\\nparallel poles, into which the ends of the bent ribs of the roof are set,\\\\r\\\\nwithout any other cross-pieces. This roof should be of two feet larger\\\\r\\\\nspan than the width of the boat, and should rest upon prolongations of\\\\r\\\\nthe thwarts, or else upon crooked knees of wood. One arm of each of the\\\\r\\\\nknees is upright, and is made fast to the inside of the boat, while the\\\\r\\\\nother is horizontal and projects outside it: it is on these horizontal\\\\r\\\\nand projecting arms that the roof rests, and to which it is lashed. Such\\\\r\\\\nan awning is airy, roomy, and does not interfere with rowing if the\\\\r\\\\nrowlocks are fixed to the poles. It also makes an excellent cabin for\\\\r\\\\nsleeping in at night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSail Tent.--A boat's sail is turned into a tent by erecting a\\\\r\\\\ngable-shaped framework: the mast or other spar being the ridge-pole, and\\\\r\\\\na pair of crossed oars lashed together supporting it at either end; and\\\\r\\\\nthe whole is made stable by a couple of ropes and pegs. Then the sail is\\\\r\\\\nthrown across the ridge-pole (not over the crossed loops of the oars, for\\\\r\\\\nthey would fret it), and is pegged out below. The natural fall of the\\\\r\\\\ncanvas bends to close the two ends, as with curtains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of tent].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTree-snakes.--Where these abound, travellers on rivers with overhanging\\\\r\\\\nbranches should beware of keeping too near inshore, lest the rigging of\\\\r\\\\nthe boat should brush down the snakes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFORDS AND BRIDGES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFords.--In fording a swift stream, carry heavy stones in your hand, for\\\\r\\\\nyou require weight to resist the force of the current: indeed, the deeper\\\\r\\\\nyou wade, the more weight you require; though you have so much the less\\\\r\\\\nat command, on account of the water buoying you up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRivers cannot be forded if their depth exceeds 3 feet for men or 4 feet\\\\r\\\\nfor horses. Fords are easily discovered by typing a sounding-pole to the\\\\r\\\\nstern of a boat rowing down the middle of the stream, and searching those\\\\r\\\\nplaces where the pole touches the bottom. When no boat is to be had,\\\\r\\\\nfords should be tried for where the river is broad rather than where it\\\\r\\\\nis narrow, and especially at those places where there are bends in its\\\\r\\\\ncourse. In these the line of shallow water does not run straight across,\\\\r\\\\nbut follows the direction of a line connecting a promontory on one side\\\\r\\\\nto the nearest promontory on the other, as in the drawing; that is to\\\\r\\\\nsay, from A to B, or from B to C, and not right across from B to b, from\\\\r\\\\nA to a, or from C to c. Along hollow curves, asa, b, c, the stream runs\\\\r\\\\ndeep, and usually beneath overhanging banks; whilst in front of\\\\r\\\\npromontories, as at A, B, and C, the water is invariably shoal, unless it\\\\r\\\\nbe a jutting rock that makes the promontory. Therefore, by entering the\\\\r\\\\nstream at one promontory, with the intention of leaving it at another,\\\\r\\\\nyou ensure that at all events the beginning and end of your course shall\\\\r\\\\nbe in shallow water, which you cannot do by attempting any other line of\\\\r\\\\npassage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of river as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Cross Boggy and Uncertain Ground.--Swamps.--When you wish to take a\\\\r\\\\nwagon across a deep, miry, and reedy swamp, outspan and leg the cattle\\\\r\\\\nfeed. Then cut faggots of reeds and strew them thickly over the line of\\\\r\\\\nintended passage. When plenty are laid down, drive the cattle backwards\\\\r\\\\nand forwards, and they will trample them in. Repeat the process two or\\\\r\\\\nthree times, till the causeway is firm enough to bear the weight of the\\\\r\\\\nwagon. Or, in default of reeds, cut long poles and several short\\\\r\\\\ncross-bars, say of two fee long; join these as best you can, so as to\\\\r\\\\nmake a couple of ladder-shaped frames. Place these across the mud, one\\\\r\\\\nunder the intended track of each wheel. Faggots strewn between each round\\\\r\\\\nof the ladder will make the causeway more sound. A succession of logs,\\\\r\\\\nlaid crosswise with faggots between them, will also do, but not so well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPassing from Hand to Hand.--When many things have to be conveyed across\\\\r\\\\na piece of abominably bad road--as over sand-dunes, heavy shingle, mud\\\\r\\\\nof two feet deep, a morass, a jagged mountain tract, or over\\\\r\\\\nstepping-stones in the bed of a rushing torrent--it is a great waste of\\\\r\\\\nlabour to make laden men travel to and fro with loads on their backs. It\\\\r\\\\nis a severe exertion to walk at all under these circumstances, letting\\\\r\\\\nalong the labour of also carrying a burden. The men should be stationed\\\\r\\\\nin a line, each at a distance of six or seven feet from his neighbour,\\\\r\\\\nand should pass the things from hand to hand, as they stand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlank Roads.--\\\\\\\"Miry, boggy lines of road, along which people had been\\\\r\\\\nseen for months crawling like flies across a plate of treacle, are\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly, and I may almost say magically, converted into a road as hard\\\\r\\\\nand good as Regent Street by the following simple process, which is\\\\r\\\\nusually adopted as soon as the feeble funds of the young colony can\\\\r\\\\npurchase the blessing. A small gang of men, with spades and rammers,\\\\r\\\\nquickly level one end of the earth road. As fast as they proceed, four or\\\\r\\\\nfive rows of strong beams or sleepers, which have been brought in the\\\\r\\\\nlight wagons of the country, are laid down longitudinally, four or five\\\\r\\\\nfeet asunder; and no sooner are they in position than from other wagons\\\\r\\\\nstout planks, touching each other, are transversely laid upon them. From\\\\r\\\\na third series of wagons, a thin layer of sand or grit is thrown upon the\\\\r\\\\nplanks, which instantly assume the appearance of a more level McAdam road\\\\r\\\\nthan in practice can ever be obtained. Upon this new-born road the wagons\\\\r\\\\ncarrying the sleepers, planks, and sand, convey, with perfect ease, these\\\\r\\\\nthree descriptions of materials for its continuance. The work advances\\\\r\\\\nliterally about as fast as an old gouty gentleman can walk; and as soon\\\\r\\\\nas it is completed, there can scarcely exist a more striking contrast\\\\r\\\\nthan between the two tenses of what it was and what it is. This 'plank\\\\r\\\\nroad,' as it is termed in America, usually lasts from eight to twelve\\\\r\\\\nyears; and as it is found quite unnecessary to spike the planks to the\\\\r\\\\nsleepers, the arrangement admits of easy repair, which, however, is but\\\\r\\\\nseldom required.\\\\\\\" (Sir Francis Head, in Times, Jan. 25.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow.--Sir R. Dalyell tells me that it is the practice of muleteers in\\\\r\\\\nthe neighbourhood of Erzeroum, when their animals lose their way and\\\\r\\\\nflounder in the deep snow, to spread a horse-cloth or other thick rug\\\\r\\\\nfrom off their packs upon the snow in front of them. The animals step\\\\r\\\\nupon it and extricate themselves easily. I have practised walking across\\\\r\\\\ndeep snow-drifts on this principle, with perfect success.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWeak Ice.--Water that is slightly frozen is made to bear a heavy wagon,\\\\r\\\\nby cutting reeds, strewing them thickly on the ice, and pouring water\\\\r\\\\nupon them; when the whole is frozen into a firm mass the process must be\\\\r\\\\nrepeated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBridges.--Flying Bridges are well known: a long cord or chain of poles\\\\r\\\\nis made fast to a rock or an anchor in the middle of a river. The other\\\\r\\\\nend is attached to the ferry-boat which being so slewed as to receive the\\\\r\\\\nforce of the current obliquely, traverses the river from side to side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBridges of Felled Trees.--If you are at the side of a narrow but deep\\\\r\\\\nand rapid river, on the banks of which trees grow long enough to reach\\\\r\\\\nacross, one or more may be felled, confining the trunk to its own bank,\\\\r\\\\nand letting the current force the head round to the opposite side; but if\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"the river be too wide to be spanned by one tree--and if two or three\\\\r\\\\nmen can in any manner be got across--let a large tree be felled into the\\\\r\\\\nwater on each side, and placed close to the banks opposite to each other,\\\\r\\\\nwith their heads lying up-streamwards. Fasten a rope to the head of each\\\\r\\\\ntree, confine the trunks, shove the head off to receive the force of the\\\\r\\\\ncurrent, and ease off the ropes, so that the branches may meet in the\\\\r\\\\nmiddle of the river at an angle pointing upwards. The branches of the\\\\r\\\\ntrees will be jammed together by the force of the current, and so be\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently united as to form a tolerable communication, especially when\\\\r\\\\na few of the upper branches have been cleared away. If insufficient,\\\\r\\\\ntowards the middle of the river, to bear the weight of men crossing, a\\\\r\\\\nfew stakes with the forks left near their heads, may be thrust down\\\\r\\\\nthrough the branches of the trees to support them.\\\\\\\" (Sir H. Douglas.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCLOTHING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--There are such infinite varieties of dress, that I\\\\r\\\\nshall only attempt a few general remarks and give a single costume, that\\\\r\\\\na traveller of great experience had used to his complete satisfaction.\\\\r\\\\nThe military authorities of different nations have long made it their\\\\r\\\\nstudy to combine in the best manner the requirements of handsome effect,\\\\r\\\\nof cheapness, and of serviceability in all climates, but I fear their\\\\r\\\\nresults will not greatly help the traveller, who looks more to\\\\r\\\\nserviceability than to anything else. Of late years, even Garibaldi with\\\\r\\\\nhis red-shirted volunteers, and Alpine men with their simple outfit, have\\\\r\\\\napproached more nearly to a traveller's ideal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaterials for Clothes.--Flannel.--The importance of flannel next the\\\\r\\\\nskin can hardly be overrated: it is now a matter of statistics; for,\\\\r\\\\nduring the progress of expeditions, notes have been made of the number of\\\\r\\\\nnames of those in them who had provided themselves with flannel, and of\\\\r\\\\nthose who had not. The list of sick and dead always included names from\\\\r\\\\nthe latter list in a very great proportion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCotton is preferable to flannel for a sedentary life, in hot damp\\\\r\\\\ncountries, or where flannel irritates the skin. Persons who are resident\\\\r\\\\nin the tropics, and dress in civilised costume, mostly wear cotton\\\\r\\\\nshirts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLinen by universal consent is a dangerous dress wherever there is a\\\\r\\\\nchance of much perspiration, for it strikes cold upon the skin when it is\\\\r\\\\nwet. The terror of Swiss guides of the old school at a coup d'air on the\\\\r\\\\nmountain top, and of Italians at the chill of sundown, is largely due to\\\\r\\\\ntheir wearing linen shirts. Those who are dressed in flannel are far less\\\\r\\\\nsensitive to these influences.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLeather is the only safeguard against the stronger kinds of thorns. In\\\\r\\\\npastoral and in hunting countries it is always easy to procure skins of a\\\\r\\\\ntough quality that have been neatly dressed by hand. Also it will be easy\\\\r\\\\nto find persons capable of sewing them together very neatly, after you\\\\r\\\\nhave cut them out to the pattern of your old clothes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBark Cloth is used in several parts of the work. It is simply a piece of\\\\r\\\\nsome kind of peculiarly fibrous bark; in Unyoro, Sir S. Baker says, the\\\\r\\\\nnatives use the bark of a species of fig-tree. They soak it in water and\\\\r\\\\nthen beat it with a mallet, to get rid of all the harder parts;--much as\\\\r\\\\nhemp is prepared. \\\\\\\"In appearance it much resembles corduroy, and is the\\\\r\\\\ncolour of tanned leather: the finer qualities are peculiarly soft to the\\\\r\\\\ntouch, as though of woven cotton.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEffect of colour on warmth of clothing.--Dark colours become hotter than\\\\r\\\\nlight colours in the sunshine, but they are not hotter under any other\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances. Consequently a person who aims at equable temperature,\\\\r\\\\nshould wear light colours. Light colours are far the best for sporting\\\\r\\\\npurposes, as they are usually much less conspicuous than black or\\\\r\\\\nrifle-green. Almost all wild beasts are tawny or fawn-coloured, or tabby,\\\\r\\\\nor of some nondescript hue and pattern: if an animal were born with a\\\\r\\\\nmore decided colour, he would soon perish for want of ability to conceal\\\\r\\\\nhimself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWarmth of different Materials.--\\\\\\\"The indefatigable Rumford made an\\\\r\\\\nelaborate series of experiments on the conductivity of the substances\\\\r\\\\nused in clothing. His method was this:--A mercurial thermometer was\\\\r\\\\nsuspended in the axis of a cylindrical glass tube ending with a globe, in\\\\r\\\\nsuch a manner that the centre of the bulb of the thermometer occupied the\\\\r\\\\ncentre of the globe; the space between the internal surface of the globe\\\\r\\\\nand the bulb was filled with the substance whose conductive power was to\\\\r\\\\nbe determined; the instrument was then heated in boiling water, and\\\\r\\\\nafterwards, being plunged into a freezing mixture of pounded ice and\\\\r\\\\nsalt, the times of cooling down 136 degrees Fahr. were noted. They are\\\\r\\\\nrecorded in the following table:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSurrounded with --                            Seconds.\\\\r\\\\nTwisted silk..................................  917\\\\r\\\\nFine lint..................................... 1032\\\\r\\\\nCotton wool.................................. 1046\\\\r\\\\nSheep's wool.................................. 1118\\\\r\\\\nTaffety....................................... 1169\\\\r\\\\nRaw silk...................................... 1264\\\\r\\\\nBeaver's fur.................................. 1296\\\\r\\\\nEider down.................................... 1305\\\\r\\\\nHare's fur.................................... 1312\\\\r\\\\nWood ashes....................................  927\\\\r\\\\nCharcoal......................................  937\\\\r\\\\nLamp-black.................................... 1117\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong the substances here examined, hare's fur offered the greatest\\\\r\\\\nimpediment to the transmission of the heat. The transmission of heat is\\\\r\\\\npowerfully influenced by the mechanical state of the body through which\\\\r\\\\nit passes. The raw and twisted silk of Rumford's table illustrate this\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n(Prof. Tyndall on Heat.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWaterproof Cloth.--Cloth is made partly waterproof by rubbing soap-suds\\\\r\\\\ninto it (on the wrong side), and working them well in: and when dry,\\\\r\\\\ndoing the same with a solution of alum; the soap is by this means\\\\r\\\\ndecomposed, and the oily part of it distributed among the fibres of the\\\\r\\\\ncloth. (See \\\\\\\"Tarpaulins.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIncombustible Stuffs.--I extract the following paragraph from a\\\\r\\\\nnewspaper. Persons who make much use of musquito curtains, will be glad\\\\r\\\\nto read it. \\\\\\\"'The Rï¿½pertoire de Chimie Pure et Appliquee' publishes the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing remarks by the celebrated chemists, MM. Dï¿½bereiner and Oesner,\\\\r\\\\non the various methods for rendering stuffs incombustible, or at least\\\\r\\\\nless inflammable than they naturally are. The substances employed for\\\\r\\\\nthis purpose are borax, alum, soluble glass, and phosphate of ammonia.\\\\r\\\\nFor wood and common stuffs, any one of these salts will do; but fine and\\\\r\\\\nlight tissues, which are just those most liable to catching fire, cannot\\\\r\\\\nbe treated in the same way. Borax renders fine textile fabrics stiff; it\\\\r\\\\ncauses dust, and will swell out under the smoothing-iron; so does alum,\\\\r\\\\nbeside weakening the fibres of the stuff, so as to make it tear easily.\\\\r\\\\nSoluble glass both stiffens and weakens the stuff, depriving it both of\\\\r\\\\nelasticity and tenacity. Phosphate of ammonia alone has none of these\\\\r\\\\ninconveniences. It may be mixed with a certain quantity of sal-ammoniac,\\\\r\\\\nand then introduced into the starch prepared for stiffening the linen; or\\\\r\\\\nelse it may be dissolved in 20 parts of water, in weight, to one of\\\\r\\\\nphosphate, and the stuff steeped into the solution, then allowed to dry,\\\\r\\\\nand ironed as usual.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPhosphate of ammonia is cheap enough to allow of its introduction into\\\\r\\\\ncommon use, so that it may be employed at each wash. Phosphate of ammonia\\\\r\\\\nis obtained by saturating the biphosphate of lime with liquid ammonia.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSewing Materials.--An outfit of sewing materials consists of needles and\\\\r\\\\nthread; scissors; tailor's thimble; wax; canvas needles, including the\\\\r\\\\nsmaller sizes which are identical with glove needles and are used for\\\\r\\\\nsewing leather; twine; a palm; awls for cobbling, both straight and\\\\r\\\\ncurved; cobbler's wax; and, possibly, bristles. The needles and awls in\\\\r\\\\nuse are conveniently carried in some kind of metal tube, with wads of\\\\r\\\\ncork at either end, to preserve their points. (See also the chapter on\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Thread, for stitches,\\\\\\\" etc.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArticles of Dress.--Hats and Caps.--There is no perfect head-dress; but\\\\r\\\\nI notice that old travellers in both hot and temperate countries have\\\\r\\\\ngenerally adopted a scanty \\\\\\\"wide-awake.\\\\\\\" Mr. Oswell, the South African\\\\r\\\\nsportsman and traveller, used for years, and strongly recommended to me,\\\\r\\\\na brimless hat of fine Panama grass, which he had sewn as a lining to an\\\\r\\\\nordinary wide-awake. I regret I have had no opportunity of trying this\\\\r\\\\ncombination, but can easily believe that the touch of the cool, smooth\\\\r\\\\ngrass, to the wet brow, would be more agreeable than that of any other\\\\r\\\\nmaterial. I need hardly mention Pith hats (to be bought under the Opera\\\\r\\\\nColonnade, Pall Mall), Indian topees, and English hunting-caps, as having\\\\r\\\\nseverally many merits. A muslin turban twisted into a rope and rolled\\\\r\\\\nround the hat is a common plan to keep the sun from the head and spine:\\\\r\\\\nit can also be used as a rope on an emergency.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCoat.--In nine cases out of ten, a strong but not too thick tweed coat\\\\r\\\\nis the best for rough work. In a very thorny country, a leather coat is\\\\r\\\\nalmost essential. A blouse, cut short so as to clear the saddle, is neat,\\\\r\\\\ncool, and easy, whether as a riding or walking costume. Generally\\\\r\\\\nspeaking, the traveller will chiefly spend his life in his shirt-sleeves,\\\\r\\\\nand will only use his coat when he wants extra warmth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo carry a Coat.--There are two ways. The first is to fold it small and\\\\r\\\\nstrap it to the belt. If the coat be a light one it can be carried very\\\\r\\\\nneatly and comfortably in this way, lying in the small of the back. The\\\\r\\\\nsecond is the contrivance of a friend of mine, an eminent scholar and\\\\r\\\\ndivine, who always employs it in his vacation rambles. It is to pass an\\\\r\\\\nordinary strap, once round the middle of the coat and a second time round\\\\r\\\\nboth the coat and the left arm just above the elbow, and then to buckle\\\\r\\\\nit. The coat hangs very comfortably in its place and does not hamper the\\\\r\\\\nmovements of the left arm. It requires no further care, except that after\\\\r\\\\na few minutes it will generally be found advisable to buckle the strap\\\\r\\\\none hole tighter. A coat carried in this way will be found to attract no\\\\r\\\\nattention from passers by.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWaistcoats are more convenient for their pockets than for their warmth.\\\\r\\\\nWhen travelling in countries where papers have to be carried, an inside\\\\r\\\\npocket between the lining and the waistcoat, with a button to close it,\\\\r\\\\nis extremely useful. Letters of credit and paper money can be carried in\\\\r\\\\nit more safely than in any other pocket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrousers.--If you are likely to have much riding, take extra leather or\\\\r\\\\nmoleskin trousers, or tweed covered down the inside of the legs with\\\\r\\\\nleather, such as cavalry soldiers generally wear. Leather is a better\\\\r\\\\nprotection than moleskin against thorns; but not so serviceable against\\\\r\\\\nwet: it will far outlast moleskin. There should be no hem to the legs of\\\\r\\\\ntrousers, as it retains the wet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWatch-pocket.--Have it made of macintosh, to save the watch from\\\\r\\\\nperspiration. The astronomer-royal of Cape Town, Sir T. Maclear, who had\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable experience of the bush when measuring an arc of the\\\\r\\\\nmeridian, justly remarked to me on the advantage of frequently turning\\\\r\\\\nthe watch-pocket inside out, to get rid of the fluff and dust that\\\\r\\\\ncollects in it and is otherwise sure to enter the watch-case.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSocks.--The hotter the ground on which you have to walk, the thicker\\\\r\\\\nshould be your socks. These should be of woollen, wherever you expect to\\\\r\\\\nhave much walking; and plenty of them will be required.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitute for Socks.--For want of socks, pieces of linen may be used,\\\\r\\\\nand, when these are properly put on they are said to be even better than\\\\r\\\\nsocks. They should be a foot square, be made of soft worn linen, be\\\\r\\\\nwashed once a-day, and be smeared with tallow. They can be put on so\\\\r\\\\ndexterously as to stand several hours' marching without making a single\\\\r\\\\nwrinkle, and are much used by soldiers in Germany. To put them on, the\\\\r\\\\nnaked foot is placed crosswise; the corners on the right and on the left\\\\r\\\\nare then folded over, then the corner which lies in front of the toes.\\\\r\\\\nNow the art consists in so drawing up these ends, that the foot can be\\\\r\\\\nplaced in the shoe or boot without any wrinkles appearing in the bandage.\\\\r\\\\nOne wrinkle is sure to make a blister, and therefore persons who have to\\\\r\\\\nuse them should practise frequently how to put them on. Socks similar to\\\\r\\\\nthese, but made of thick blanket, and called \\\\\\\"Blanket Wrappers,\\\\\\\" are in\\\\r\\\\nuse at Hudson's Bay instead of shoes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShirt-sleeves.--When you have occasion to tuck up your shirt-sleeves,\\\\r\\\\nrecollect that the way of doing so is, not to begin by turning the cuffs\\\\r\\\\ninside out, but outside in--the sleeves must be rolled up inwards,\\\\r\\\\ntowards the arm, and not the reverse way. In the one case, the sleeves\\\\r\\\\nwill remain tucked up for hours without being touched; in the other, they\\\\r\\\\nbecome loose every five minutes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGloves, Mits, and Muffs.--In cold dry weather a pair of old soft kid\\\\r\\\\ngloves, with large woollen gloves drawn over them, is the warmest\\\\r\\\\ncombination. Mits and muffetees merely require mention. To keep the hands\\\\r\\\\nwarm in very severe weather, a small fur muff may be slung from the neck,\\\\r\\\\nin which the hands may rest till wanted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBraces.--Do not forget to take them, unless you have had abundant\\\\r\\\\nexperience of belts; for belts do not suit every shape, neither are\\\\r\\\\nEnglish trousers cut with the intention of being worn with them. But\\\\r\\\\ntrousers made abroad, are shaped at the waist, especially for the purpose\\\\r\\\\nof being worn without braces; if desired. If you use braces, take two\\\\r\\\\npairs, for when they are drenched with perspiration, they dry slowly.\\\\r\\\\nSome people do not care to use a belt, even with trousers of an ordinary\\\\r\\\\ncut, but find that a tape run through a hem along the upper edge of the\\\\r\\\\ntrousers acts sufficiently well. Capt. Speke told me he always used this\\\\r\\\\nplan.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoots.--Boots of tanned leather such as civilised people wear, are\\\\r\\\\nincomparably better for hard usage, especially in wet countries, than\\\\r\\\\nthose of hand-dressed skins. If travelling in a hot, dry country, grease\\\\r\\\\nplentifully both your shoes and all other leather. \\\\\\\"La graisse est la\\\\r\\\\nconservation du cuir,\\\\\\\" as I recollect a Chamouni guide enunciating with\\\\r\\\\nprofound emphasis. The soles of plaited cord used in parts of the\\\\r\\\\nPyrenees, are durable and excellent for clambering over smooth rock. They\\\\r\\\\nhave a far better hold upon it than any other sole of which I have\\\\r\\\\nknowledge. Sandals are better than nothing at all. So are cloths wound\\\\r\\\\nround the feet and ankles and tied there: the peasants of the remarkable\\\\r\\\\nhilly place where I am writing these lines, namely Amalfi, use them much.\\\\r\\\\nThey are an untidy chaussure, but never seem to require to be tied\\\\r\\\\nafresh. In the old days of Rome this sort of foot-gear was common.\\\\r\\\\nHaybands wound round the feet are a common makeshift by soldiers who are\\\\r\\\\ncut off from their supplies. It takes some months to harden the feet\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently to be able to walk without shoes at all. Slippers are great\\\\r\\\\nluxuries to foot-sore men. They should of course be of soft material, but\\\\r\\\\nthe soles should not be too thin or they will be too cold for comfort in\\\\r\\\\ncamp life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLeggings.--Macintosh leggings to go over the trousers are a great\\\\r\\\\ncomfort in heavy showers, especially when riding.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGaiters.--If the country be full of briars and thorns, the insteps\\\\r\\\\nsuffer cruelly when riding through bushes. It is easy to make gaiters\\\\r\\\\neither with buttons or buckles. A strip of wood is wanted, either behind\\\\r\\\\nor else on each side of them, to keep them from slipping down to the\\\\r\\\\nankle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDressing Gown.--Persons who travel, even with the smallest quantity of\\\\r\\\\nluggage, would do wisely to take a thick dressing-gown. It is a relief to\\\\r\\\\nput it on in the evening, and is a warm extra dress for sleeping in. It\\\\r\\\\nis eminently useful, comfortable and durable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoncho.--A poncho is useful, for it is a sheet as well as a cloak; being\\\\r\\\\nsimply a blanket with a slit in the middle to admit the wearer's head. A\\\\r\\\\nsheet of strong calico, saturated with oil, makes a waterproof poncho.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nComplete Bush-costume.--Mr. Gordon Cumming describes his bush-costume as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--\\\\\\\"My own personal appointments consisted of a wide-awake hat,\\\\r\\\\nsecured under my chin by 'rheimpys' or strips of dressed skin, a coarse\\\\r\\\\nlinen shirt, sometimes a kilt, and sometimes a pair of buckskin\\\\r\\\\nknee-breeches, and a pair of 'veltschoens,' or home-made shoes. I\\\\r\\\\nentirely discarded coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth; and I always hunted\\\\r\\\\nwith my arms bare; my heels were armed with a pair of powerful\\\\r\\\\npersuaders, and from my left wrist depended, by a double rheimpy (thong),\\\\r\\\\nan equally persuasive sea-cow jambok (whip of solid leather). Around my\\\\r\\\\nwaist I wore two leathern belts or girdles. The smaller did the duty of\\\\r\\\\nsuspender, and from it on my left side depended a plaited rheimpy, eight\\\\r\\\\ninches in length, forming a loop, in which dangled my powerful\\\\r\\\\nloading-rod, formed of a solid piece of horn of the rhinoceros. The\\\\r\\\\nlarger girdle was my shooting-belt; this was a broad leather belt, on\\\\r\\\\nwhich were fastened four separate compartments, made of otterskin, with\\\\r\\\\nflaps to button over, of the same material. The first of these held my\\\\r\\\\npercussion-caps; the second, a large powder-flask; the third and fourth,\\\\r\\\\nwhich had divisions in them, contained balls and patches, two sharp\\\\r\\\\nclasp-knives, a compass, flint and steel. In this belt I also carried a\\\\r\\\\nloading-mallet, formed from the horn of the rhinoceros; this and the\\\\r\\\\npowder-flask were each secured to the belt by long rheimpys, to prevent\\\\r\\\\nmy losing them. Last, but not least, in my right hand I usually carried\\\\r\\\\nmy double-barrelled two-grooved rifle, which was my favourite weapon.\\\\r\\\\nThis, however, I subsequently made up my mind was not the tool for a\\\\r\\\\nmounted man, especially when quick loading is required.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWet Clothes, to dry.--Fire for drying Clothes.--To dry clothes it is a\\\\r\\\\nvery convenient plan to make a dome-shaped framework of twigs over a\\\\r\\\\nsmouldering fire; by bending each twig or wand into a half-circle, and\\\\r\\\\nplanting both ends of it in the ground, one on each side of the fire. The\\\\r\\\\nwet clothes are laid on this framework, and receive the full benefit of\\\\r\\\\nthe heat. Their steam passes readily upwards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Two sketches of drying frame].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo keep Clothes from the wet.--Mr. Parkyns says, \\\\\\\"I may as well tell,\\\\r\\\\nalso, how we managed to keep our clothes dry when travelling in the rain:\\\\r\\\\nthis was rather an important consideration, seeing that each man's\\\\r\\\\nwardrobe consisted of what he carried on his back. Our method was at once\\\\r\\\\neffective and simple: if halting, we took off our clothes and sat on\\\\r\\\\nthem; if riding, they were placed under the leathern shabraque of the\\\\r\\\\nmule's saddle, or under any article of similar material, bed or bag, that\\\\r\\\\nlay on the camel's pack. A good shower-bath did none of us any harm; and\\\\r\\\\nas soon as the rain was over, and the moisture on our skins had\\\\r\\\\nevaporated, we had our garments as warm, dry, and comfortable as if they\\\\r\\\\nhad been before a fire. In populous districts, we kept on our drawers, or\\\\r\\\\nsupplied their place with a piece of rag, or a skin; and then, when the\\\\r\\\\nrain was over, we wrapped ourselves up in our 'quarry,' and taking off\\\\r\\\\nthe wetted articles, hung them over the animal's cruppers to dry.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nAnother traveller writes:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The only means we had of preserving our sole suit of clothes dry from\\\\r\\\\nthe drenching showers of rain, was by taking them off and stuffing them\\\\r\\\\ninto the hollow of a tree, which in the darkness of the night we could do\\\\r\\\\nwith propriety.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Palliser's boatmen at Chagre took each a small piece of cloth, under\\\\r\\\\nwhich they laid their clothes every time that they stripped in\\\\r\\\\nexpectation of a coming storm.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDipping clothes wetted with rain, in Sea-water.--Captain Bligh, who was\\\\r\\\\nturned adrift in an open boat after the mutiny of the 'Bounty,' writes\\\\r\\\\nthus about his experience:--\\\\\\\"With respect to the preservation of our\\\\r\\\\nhealth, during a course of 16 days of heavy and almost continual rain, I\\\\r\\\\nwould recommend to every one in a similar situation the method we\\\\r\\\\npractised, which is to dip their clothes in the salt water and wring them\\\\r\\\\nout as often as they become filled with rain: it was the only resource we\\\\r\\\\nhad, and I believe was of the greatest service to us, for it felt more\\\\r\\\\nlike a change of dry clothes than could well be imagined. We had occasion\\\\r\\\\nto do this so often, that at length our clothes were wrung to pieces; for\\\\r\\\\nexcept the few days we passed on the coast of New Holland, we were\\\\r\\\\ncontinually wet, either with rain or sea.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWashing Clothes.--Substitute for Soap.--The lye of ashes and the gall\\\\r\\\\nof animals are the readiest substitutes for soap. The sailor's recipe for\\\\r\\\\nwashing clothes is well known, but it is too dirty to describe. Bran, and\\\\r\\\\nthe meal of many seeds, is good for scouring: also some earths, like\\\\r\\\\nfuller's-earth. Many countries possess plants that will make a lather\\\\r\\\\nwith water. Dr. Rae says that in a very cold climate, when fire, water,\\\\r\\\\nand the means of drying are scarce, it will be found that rubbing\\\\r\\\\nandbeating in snow cleanses all clothing remarkably well, particularly\\\\r\\\\nwoollens. When preparing for a regular day's washing, it is a good plan\\\\r\\\\nto boil an abundance of ashes in water, strain off the lye, adding the\\\\r\\\\ngall of any animal you may have killed, and let the clothes soak in it.\\\\r\\\\nNext morning, take them to the water-side, and wash and beat them with a\\\\r\\\\nflat piece of wood, or lay them on a broad stone and knead and wring them\\\\r\\\\nwith the hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLye of Ashes.--In choosing plants to burn for ashes (whence the lye is\\\\r\\\\nto be made by pouring hot water on them), it must be recollected that all\\\\r\\\\nplants are not equally efficacious: those that contain the most alkali\\\\r\\\\n(either potash or soda) are the best. On this account, the stalks of\\\\r\\\\nsucculent plants, as reeds, maize, broom, heath, and furze, are very much\\\\r\\\\nbetter than the wood of any trees; and twigs are better than timber. Pine\\\\r\\\\nand fir-trees are the worst of woods. The ashes of most kinds of seaweed\\\\r\\\\nyield abundance of alkali. Potash is the alkali that is obtained from the\\\\r\\\\nashes of land plants, and soda from those of marine plants.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n10,000 parts of  pine or fur.......contain.... 4 parts of alkali.\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             poplar                 \\\\\\\"      7        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             beech-wood             \\\\\\\"     14        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             oak                    \\\\\\\"     15        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             willow                 \\\\\\\"     28        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             elm, maple,\\\\r\\\\n                  and wheat straw.      \\\\\\\"     39        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             thistles, flax-stems,\\\\r\\\\n                  and small rushes      \\\\\\\"     50        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             large rushes           \\\\\\\"     72        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"             stalk of maize         \\\\\\\"    175        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n   \\\\\\\"              bean-stalks           \\\\\\\"    200        \\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSoap is made by keeping fat constantly simmering in lye of ashes (see\\\\r\\\\npreceding paragraphs) for some days; adding fresh lye as fast as the\\\\r\\\\nwater boils away, or is sucked up by the fat. After one or two trials,\\\\r\\\\nthe knack of soap-making is easily caught. The presence of salt makes the\\\\r\\\\nsoap hard; its absence, soft; now many ashes contain a good deal of salt,\\\\r\\\\nand these may make the soap too hard, and will have to be mixed with\\\\r\\\\nother sorts of ashes before being used: experience must guide the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller in this. A native woman will be probably be found without\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty, who will attend night and day to the pot-boiling for a small\\\\r\\\\npayment. Inferior soap may be made by simply putting some grease into a\\\\r\\\\ntub of very strong lye, and letting it remain for two or three weeks,\\\\r\\\\nwithout any boiling, but stirring it every day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMarine Soap is made of soda lye (the lye of seaweeds) and cocoa-nut oil;\\\\r\\\\nit makes a lather with salt water, but it has the defect of being very\\\\r\\\\nbulky.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo wash Flannels.--Make a lather of soap on a small piece of flannel, and\\\\r\\\\nrub with it those parts that require the most cleansing, such as the neck\\\\r\\\\nand wristbands of a shirt; then plunge the shirt in water as hot as you\\\\r\\\\ncan bear it, rinsing it and wringing it out very thoroughly, and hang it\\\\r\\\\nup to dry as quickly as possible. Soda should not be used with coloured\\\\r\\\\nflannels.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWashing Oneself.--Warmth of Dirt.--There is no denying the fact, though\\\\r\\\\nit be not agreeable to confess it, that dirt and grease are great\\\\r\\\\nprotectors of the skin against inclement weather, and that therefore the\\\\r\\\\nleader of a party should not be too exacting about the appearance of his\\\\r\\\\nless warmly-clad followers. Daily washing, if not followed by oiling,\\\\r\\\\nmust be compensated by wearing clothes. Take the instance of a dog. He\\\\r\\\\nwill sleep out under any bush, and thrive there, so long as he is not\\\\r\\\\nwashed, groomed, and kept clean; but if he be, he must have a kennel to\\\\r\\\\nlie in, the same is the case with a horse; he catches cold if he is\\\\r\\\\ngroomed in the day, and turned out at nights; but he never catches cold\\\\r\\\\nwhen left wholly to himself. A savage will never wash unless he can\\\\r\\\\ngrease himself afterwards--grease takes the place of clothing to him.\\\\r\\\\nThere must be a balance between the activity of the skin and the calls\\\\r\\\\nupon it; and where the exposure is greater, there must the pores be more\\\\r\\\\ndefended. In Europe, we pass our lives in a strangely artificial state;\\\\r\\\\nour whole body swathed in many folds of dress, excepting the hands and\\\\r\\\\nface--the first of which are frequently gloved. We can afford to wash,\\\\r\\\\nbut naked men cannot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBest Times for Washing.--The most convenient time for a traveller to make\\\\r\\\\nhis toilet, in rough travel, is after the early morning's ride, a bath\\\\r\\\\nbeing now and then taken in the afternoon. It is trying work to wash in\\\\r\\\\nice-cold water, in the dark and blowing morning; besides which, when the\\\\r\\\\nsun rises up, its scorching heat tells severely on a face that has been\\\\r\\\\nwashed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nToilet made overnight.--During the harassing duties of active warfare,\\\\r\\\\nofficers who aim at appearing in a decorous dress, in whatever emergency\\\\r\\\\ntheir presence may be required, make their toilet overnight before going\\\\r\\\\nto sleep.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEconomising Water in Washing.--Where water has to be economised, by far\\\\r\\\\nthe best way of using it is after the Mahomedan fashion. An attendant\\\\r\\\\npours a slender stream from a jug, which the man who washes himself\\\\r\\\\nreceives in his hands and distributes over his person.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBath-glove.--Fold a piece of very coarse towel in two parts: lay your\\\\r\\\\nhand upon it, and mark its outline rudely; then guided by the outline,\\\\r\\\\ncut it out: sew the two pieces together, along their edges, and the glove\\\\r\\\\nis made. It is inexpensive, and portable, and as good a detergent as\\\\r\\\\nhorsehair gloves or flesh-brushes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBrushes.--It is well to know how to make a brush, whether for clothes,\\\\r\\\\nboots, or hair, and the accompanying section of one will explain itself.\\\\r\\\\nBristles are usually employed, but fibres of various kinds may be used.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of brush].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBEDDING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--The most bulky, and often the heaviest, parts of a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller's equipment are his clothes, sleeping-mat, and blankets: nor is\\\\r\\\\nit at all desirable that these should be stinted in quantity; for the\\\\r\\\\nhardship that most tries a man's constitution and lays the seeds of\\\\r\\\\nrheumatism, dysentery, and fever, is that of enduring the bitter cold of\\\\r\\\\na stormy night, which may happen to follow an exhausting day of extreme\\\\r\\\\nheat or drenching wet. After many months' travel and camping, the\\\\r\\\\nconstitution becomes far less susceptible of injury from cold and damp,\\\\r\\\\nbut in no case is it ever proof against their influence. Indeed, the\\\\r\\\\noldest travellers are ever those who go the most systematically to work,\\\\r\\\\nin making their sleeping-places dry and warm. Unless a traveller makes\\\\r\\\\nhimself at home and comfortable in the bush, he will never be quite\\\\r\\\\ncontented with his lot; but will fall into the bad habit of looking\\\\r\\\\nforwards to the end of his journey, and to his return to civilisation,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of complacently interesting himself in its continuance. This is a\\\\r\\\\nframe of mind in which few great journeys have been successfully\\\\r\\\\naccomplished; and an explorer who cannot divest himself of it, may\\\\r\\\\nsuspect that he has mistaken his vocation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is a common idea among men who are preparing to travel for the first\\\\r\\\\ntime, that all the bed-clothing about which they need concern themselves,\\\\r\\\\nis a sufficiency to cover them, forgetting that a man has an under as\\\\r\\\\nwell as an upper side to keep warm, and must therefore have clothing\\\\r\\\\nbetween him and the earth, as well as between him and the air. Indeed, on\\\\r\\\\ntrying the experiment, and rolling oneself up in a single blanket, the\\\\r\\\\nundermost side in a cold night is found to be by far the colder of the\\\\r\\\\ntwo. The substance of the blanket is compressed by the weight of the\\\\r\\\\nsleeper; the interstices between its fibres cease to exist; and the air\\\\r\\\\nwhich they contained and which is a powerful non-conductor of heat, is\\\\r\\\\nsqueezed out. Consequently wherever the blanket is compressed, its power\\\\r\\\\nof retaining the heat of the sleeper is diminished. Soft fleecy\\\\r\\\\nsubstances, like eider-down quilts, which are extremely warm as\\\\r\\\\ncoverlets, are well-nigh useless as mattresses. There is another cause\\\\r\\\\nwhy a sleeper requires more protection from below, than from above: it is\\\\r\\\\nthat if the ground be at all wet, its damp will penetrate through very\\\\r\\\\nthick substances laid upon it. It will therefore be clearly understood\\\\r\\\\nthat the object of a mattress is not alone to give softness to the bed,\\\\r\\\\nbut also to give warmth; and that if a man lies in a hammock, with only\\\\r\\\\nthe hammock below, and blankets above, he will be fully as much chilled\\\\r\\\\nas if the arrangement had been reversed, and he had lain upon blankets,\\\\r\\\\nwith only the hammock as a sheet to cover him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVital Heat.--The vital heat of a man, either in an active or a latent\\\\r\\\\nform, is equal to that which is given out by two ordinary candles: I\\\\r\\\\njudge so from the following reasons. All our vital heat is produced by\\\\r\\\\nthe combustion--for it is simple combustion--of the carbon in our food.\\\\r\\\\nNow the quantity of carbon consumed by a man in full diet, in 24 hours,\\\\r\\\\nis about 22 oz. in weight. On the other hand, I find that ordinary\\\\r\\\\ncandles, which mainly consist of carbon, burn at the rate of 11 oz. in 24\\\\r\\\\nhours. Therefore the heat given out by two candles is just about the same\\\\r\\\\nas that given out by one man, either in a sensible form, or else under a\\\\r\\\\nlatent form by the vapour of the breath. Secondly, I have frequently\\\\r\\\\nheard it estimated, as the result of the ordinary experience of social\\\\r\\\\nlife, that a saloon is warmed by each couple of candles somewhat more\\\\r\\\\nthan it is by the presence of a single guest. Where I write these lines,\\\\r\\\\nI have not an opportunity of verifying my rough estimate, by reference to\\\\r\\\\nphysiological works, but accuracy is of little consequence to my present\\\\r\\\\npurpose, which is to give a general idea of the magnitude of the problem\\\\r\\\\nto be solved by clothes and tenting. Their joint office is to retain the\\\\r\\\\nheat of a mass of flesh and blood, the size and shape of a man, warmed by\\\\r\\\\ntwo candles burning within it, at a temperature of not less than 96\\\\r\\\\ndegrees in its inward parts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMattresses and their Substitutes.--A Strip of Macintosh.--If a traveller\\\\r\\\\ncan do so, he should make a point of having a strip of macintosh sheeting\\\\r\\\\n7 feet by 4, certainly not less than 6 feet by 3, to lay on the ground\\\\r\\\\nbelow his bedding. Every white servant in the expedition ought to be\\\\r\\\\nfurnished with a strip of macintosh sheeting, or, failing that, with a\\\\r\\\\nstrip of painted canvas. However, painted cloth is much inferior to\\\\r\\\\nmacintosh, as it will not fold up without cracking: it also tears easily,\\\\r\\\\nand is heavy. Macintosh, of the sort that suits all climates, and made of\\\\r\\\\nlinen, not of silk, is invaluable to an explorer, whether in the form of\\\\r\\\\nsheeting, coats, water-bags. swimming belts, or inflatable boats. A\\\\r\\\\nlittle box full of the composition for mending it, and a spare bit of\\\\r\\\\nmacintosh, should always be taken.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMattress.--Making a mattress is indeed a very simple affair. A bag of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas, or other cloth, is made of the size wanted. It is then stuffed\\\\r\\\\nfull of hair, wool, dry leaves, or cotton, and a strong stitch is put\\\\r\\\\nthrough it every few inches. The use of the stitching is to prevent the\\\\r\\\\nstuffing from being displaced, and forming lumps in different parts of\\\\r\\\\nthe bag.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPalliasse.--Straw, well knitted or plaited together, forms a good\\\\r\\\\nmattress, commonly called a palliasse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShavings of Wood.--Eight pounds' weight of shavings make an excellent\\\\r\\\\nbed, and I find I can cut them with a common spokeshave, in 3 1/2 hours,\\\\r\\\\nout of a log of deal. It is practicable to make an efficient spokeshave,\\\\r\\\\nby tying a large clasp-knife on a common stick which has been cut into a\\\\r\\\\nproper shape to receive it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOakum.--Old cord, picked into oakum, will also make a bed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVarious Makeshifts.--If a traveller, as is very commonly the case, should\\\\r\\\\nhave no mattress, he should strew his sleeping-place with dry grass,\\\\r\\\\nplucked up from the ground, or with other things warm to the touch,\\\\r\\\\nimitating the structure of a bird's-nest as far as he has skill and\\\\r\\\\nmaterials to do so. Leaves, fern, feathers, heather, rushes, flags of\\\\r\\\\nreeds and of maize, wood-shavings, bundles of faggots, and such like\\\\r\\\\nmaterials as chance may afford, should be looked for and appropriated; a\\\\r\\\\npile of stones, or even two trunks of trees rolled close together, may\\\\r\\\\nmake a dry bedstead in a marshy land. Over these, let him lay whatever\\\\r\\\\nempty bags, skins, saddle-cloths, or spare clothes he may have, which\\\\r\\\\nfrom their shape or smallness cannot be turned to account as coverings,\\\\r\\\\nand the lower part of his bed is complete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf a night of unusual cold be expected, the best use to make of spare\\\\r\\\\nwearing-apparel, is to put it on over that which is already on the\\\\r\\\\nperson. With two or three shirts, stockings, and trousers, though\\\\r\\\\nseverally of thin materials, a man may get through a night of very trying\\\\r\\\\nweather.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPreparing the Ground for a Bed.--Travellers should always root up the\\\\r\\\\nstones and sticks that might interfere with the smoothness of the place\\\\r\\\\nwhere they intend to sleep. This is a matter worth taking a great deal of\\\\r\\\\npains about; the oldest campaigners are the most particular in making\\\\r\\\\nthemselves comfortable at night. They should also scrape a hollow in the\\\\r\\\\nground, of the shape shown in fig. 2 (next page), before spreading their\\\\r\\\\nsleeping-rugs. It is disagreeable enough to lie on a perfectly level\\\\r\\\\nsurface, like that of a floor, but the acme of discomfort is to lie upon\\\\r\\\\na convexity. Persons who have omitted to make a shapely lair for\\\\r\\\\nthemselves, should at least scrape a hollow in the ground, just where the\\\\r\\\\nhip-bone would otherwise press.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of person sleeping and bed; Fig. 1 and 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe annexed sketch (fig. 1) represents a man sleeping in a natural\\\\r\\\\nattitude. It will be observed that he fits into a concavity of about 6\\\\r\\\\ninches in greatest depth. (The scale on which he is drawn is 6 feet long\\\\r\\\\nand 1 foot high.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHammocks.--See section on \\\\\\\"furniture.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCoverlets.--General Remarks.--For an upper cover, it is of importance to\\\\r\\\\nan otherwise unsheltered person, that its texture should be such as to\\\\r\\\\nprevent the wind blowing through. If it does so, no thickness is of any\\\\r\\\\navail in keeping out the cold; hence the advantage of skin carosses,\\\\r\\\\nbuffalo robes, leather sheets, and macintosh rugs. All clothes lose much\\\\r\\\\nof their closeness of texture in a hot, dry climate; the fibres shrink\\\\r\\\\nextremely, and the wind blows through the tissue as through network. It\\\\r\\\\nis in order to make their coverings wind-proof, that shepherd-lads on the\\\\r\\\\nhills in Scotland, when the nights are cold, dip their plaids in water,\\\\r\\\\nbefore sitting or lying down in them. The wet swells up the fibres of the\\\\r\\\\nplaid, and makes the texture of it perfectly dense and close. It is also\\\\r\\\\nof importance that the outer covering should have a certain weight, so as\\\\r\\\\nnot to be too easily displaced, either by the person fidgeting in his\\\\r\\\\nsleep or by the blowing of the wind. In dry weather there is nothing like\\\\r\\\\nfurs; but in a rainy country I prefer a thick blanket bag (see \\\\\\\"Sleeping\\\\r\\\\nBags\\\\\\\"), a large spare blanket, and a macintosh sheet and counterpane. It\\\\r\\\\nmay be objected that the bag and macintosh would be close and stuffy, but\\\\r\\\\nbe assured that the difficulty when sleeping on mother earth, on a bitter\\\\r\\\\nnight, is to keep the fresh air out, not to let it in. On fine nights I\\\\r\\\\nshould sleep on the bag and under the spare blanket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStuffy Bedding.--It must be understood that while recommending coverlets\\\\r\\\\nthat resist the wind, I am very far from advocating extreme stuffiness,\\\\r\\\\nand for the following reason. Though a free passage of the wind abstracts\\\\r\\\\nan excessive amount of animal heat from the sleeper, yet the freshness of\\\\r\\\\npure air stimulates his body to give it out in an increased proportion.\\\\r\\\\nOn the other hand, sleeping-clothes that are absolutely impervious to the\\\\r\\\\npassage of the wind, necessarily retain the cutaneous excretions: these\\\\r\\\\npoison the sleeper, acting upon his blood through his skin, and\\\\r\\\\nmaterially weaken his power of emitting vital heat: the fire of his life\\\\r\\\\nburns more languidly. I therefore suspect it would be more dangerous to\\\\r\\\\npass a very cold night enclosed tightly in thin macintosh buttoned up to\\\\r\\\\nthe chin, than without it. Much less heat would be robbed from the\\\\r\\\\nsleeper in the first case, but he would have very much less heat to\\\\r\\\\nspare. There is, therefore, an intermediate arrangement of sleeping-gear,\\\\r\\\\nneither too stuffy on the one hand nor too open on the other, by which\\\\r\\\\nthe maximum power of resisting the chill of the night is obtainable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSleeping Clothes.--Some travellers prefer to have their blanket at once\\\\r\\\\nmade up into a loose coat, trousers, and cap, pockets ad libitum, and a\\\\r\\\\ntape in the trouser band. An extra suit is thus always at hand, the\\\\r\\\\nsleeper loses little of the advantages of comfortable bedding, and is\\\\r\\\\nalways, in some sense, dressed for any emergency.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFeathers.--When you collect bed feathers for coverlets, recollect that if\\\\r\\\\nthey are cleanly plucked, they will require no dressing of any kind, save\\\\r\\\\ndrying and beating.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBrown Paper.--Brown paper is an excellent non-conductor of heat and\\\\r\\\\nexcluder of draughts: English cottagers often enclose sheets of it within\\\\r\\\\ntheir quilted counterpanes. If thoroughly soaked and then dried, it will\\\\r\\\\nnot crackle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nExtra Clothes.--If a man be destitute of proper wraps, he cannot do\\\\r\\\\nbetter than put on all the spare clothes he possesses. The additional\\\\r\\\\nwarmth of a single extra shirt is remarkable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDry Clothes.--However wet the weather may be during the day, the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller should never relax his endeavours to keep a dry and warm change\\\\r\\\\nof clothes for his bivouac at night. Hardships in rude weather matter\\\\r\\\\nlittle to a healthy man, when he is awake and moving, and while the sun\\\\r\\\\nis above the horizon; but let him never forget the deplorable results\\\\r\\\\nthat may follow a single night's exposure to cold, malaria, and damp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPillows.--A mound of sand or earth, scraped together for a pillow, is\\\\r\\\\nground down into flatness, after a few minutes. A bag filled with earth,\\\\r\\\\nor it may be with grass, keeps its shape. Many people use their saddles\\\\r\\\\nas pillows; they roll up the flaps and stirrups, and place the saddle on\\\\r\\\\nthe ground with a stone underneath, at its hindmost end, to keep it level\\\\r\\\\nand steady, and then lay their heads on the seat. I prefer using anything\\\\r\\\\nelse; as, for instance, the stone without the saddle: but I generally\\\\r\\\\nsecure some bag or other for the purpose, as, without a pillow, it is\\\\r\\\\ndifficult to sleep in comfort. A bag shaped like a pillow-case, and\\\\r\\\\nstuffed with spare clothes, is very convenient. Some people advocate\\\\r\\\\nair-cushions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Mansfield Parkyns' excellent plan, of sleeping on the side, with the\\\\r\\\\nstock of the gun between the head and the arm, and the barrel between the\\\\r\\\\nlegs, will be described when I speak of \\\\\\\"Guns.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBIVOUAC.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere are four ways in which travellers who are thrown upon their own\\\\r\\\\nresources may house themselves. They may bivouac, that is to say, they\\\\r\\\\nmay erect a temporary shelter of a makeshift character, partly from\\\\r\\\\nmaterials found on the spot, and partly from the cloths they may happen\\\\r\\\\nto possess; they may build a substantial hut, which of course takes a\\\\r\\\\ngood deal of labour to complete; they may use sleeping-bags; or they may\\\\r\\\\npitch a regular tent. I will speak of these four methods of encamping,\\\\r\\\\n--the bivouac, the hut, the sleeping-bag, and the tent, in that order.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Bivouacking is miserable work in a wet or unhealthy\\\\r\\\\nclimate; but in a dry and healthy one, there is no question of its\\\\r\\\\nsuperiority over tenting. Men who sleep habitually in the open, breathe\\\\r\\\\nfresher air and are far more imbued with the spirit of wild life, than\\\\r\\\\nthose who pass the night within the stuffy enclosure of a tent. It is an\\\\r\\\\nendless pleasure to lie half awake watching the stars above, and the\\\\r\\\\npicturesque groupings of the encampment round about, and to hear on all\\\\r\\\\nsides the stirrings of animal life. And later in the night, when the fire\\\\r\\\\nis low, and servants and cattle are asleep, and there is no sound but of\\\\r\\\\nthe wind and an occasional plaintive cry of wild animals, the traveller\\\\r\\\\nfinds himself in that close communion with nature which is the true charm\\\\r\\\\nof wild travel. Now all this pleasure is lost by sleeping in a tent. Tent\\\\r\\\\nlife is semi-civilization, and perpetuates its habits. This may be\\\\r\\\\nillustrated by a simple trait; a man who has lived much in bivouacs, if\\\\r\\\\nthere be a night alarm, runs naturally into the dark for safety, just as\\\\r\\\\na wild animal would; but a man who travels with tents becomes frightened\\\\r\\\\nwhen away from its lights, or from the fancied security of its walls.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn a dangerous country there can be no comparison between the hazard of a\\\\r\\\\ntent and that of a bivouac. In the former a man's sleep is heavy; he\\\\r\\\\ncannot hear nearly so well; he can see nothing; his cattle may all\\\\r\\\\ndecamp; while marauders know exactly where he is lying, and may make\\\\r\\\\ntheir plans accordingly. They may creep up unobserved and spear him\\\\r\\\\nthrough the canvas. The first Napoleon had a great opinion of the\\\\r\\\\nadvantages of bivouacking over those of tenting. He said it was the\\\\r\\\\nhealthier of the two for soldiers. (See p. 153.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShelter from the Wind.--Study the form of a hare! In the flattest and\\\\r\\\\nmost unpromising of fields, the creature will have availed herself of\\\\r\\\\nsome little hollow to the lee of an insignificant tuft of grass, and\\\\r\\\\nthere she will have nestled and fidgeted about till she has made a\\\\r\\\\nsmooth, round, grassy bed, compact and fitted to her shape, where she may\\\\r\\\\ncurl herself snugly up, and cower down below the level of the cutting\\\\r\\\\nnight wind. Follow her example. A man, as he lies upon his mother earth,\\\\r\\\\nis an object so small and low that a screen of eighteen inches high will\\\\r\\\\nguard him securely from the strength of a storm. A common mistake of a\\\\r\\\\nnovice lies in selecting a tree for his camping-place, which spreads out\\\\r\\\\nnobly above, but affords no other shelter from the wind than that of its\\\\r\\\\nbare stem below.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of sleeping man behind wall].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt may be, that as he walks about in search of shelter, a mass of foliage\\\\r\\\\nat the level of his eye, with its broad shadow, attracts him, and as he\\\\r\\\\nstands to the leeward of it it seems snug, and, therefore, without\\\\r\\\\nfurther reflection, he orders his bed to be spread at the foot of some\\\\r\\\\ntree. But as soon as he lies down on the ground the tree proves worthless\\\\r\\\\nas a screen against the wind; it is a roof, but it is not a wall. The\\\\r\\\\nreal want in blowy weather is a dense low screen, perfectly wind-tight,\\\\r\\\\nas high as the knee above the ground. Thus, if a traveller has to encamp\\\\r\\\\non a bare turf plain, he need only turn up a sod seven feet long by two\\\\r\\\\nfeet wide, and if he succeeds in propping it on its edge, it will form a\\\\r\\\\nsufficient shield against the wind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn heavy gales, the neighbourhood of a solitary tree is a positive\\\\r\\\\nnuisance. It creates a violent eddy of wind, that leaves palpable\\\\r\\\\nevidence of its existence. Thus, in corn-fields, it is a common result of\\\\r\\\\na storm to batter the corn quite flat in circles round each tree that\\\\r\\\\nstands in the field, while elsewhere no injury takes place. This very\\\\r\\\\nmorning that I am writing these remarks, November 158, I was\\\\r\\\\nforcibly struck by the appearance of Kensington Gardens, after last\\\\r\\\\nnight's gale, which had covered the ground with an extraordinary amount\\\\r\\\\nof dead leaves. They lay in a remarkably uniform layer, of from three to\\\\r\\\\nfive inches in depth, except that round each and every tree the ground\\\\r\\\\nwas absolutely bare of leaves for a radius of about a yard. The effect\\\\r\\\\nwas as though circular discs had been cut out, leaving the edges of the\\\\r\\\\nlayer of leaves perfectly sharp and vertical. It would have been a\\\\r\\\\ndangerous mistake to have slept that night at the foot of any one of\\\\r\\\\nthose trees.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain, in selecting a place for bivouac, we must bear in mind that a gale\\\\r\\\\nnever blows in level currents, but in all kinds of curls and eddies, as\\\\r\\\\nthe driving of a dust-storm, or the vagaries of bits of straw caught up\\\\r\\\\nby the wind, unmistakably show us. Little hillocks or undulations,\\\\r\\\\ncombined with the general lay of the ground, are a chief cause of these\\\\r\\\\neddies; they entirely divert the current of the wind from particular\\\\r\\\\nspots. Such spots should be looked for; they are discovered by watching\\\\r\\\\nthe grass or the sand that lies on the ground. If the surface be quiet in\\\\r\\\\none place, while all around it is agitated by the wind, we shall not be\\\\r\\\\nfar wrong in selecting that place for our bed, however unprotected it may\\\\r\\\\nseem in other respects. It is constantly remarked, that a very slight\\\\r\\\\nmound or ridge will shelter the ground for many feet behind it; and an\\\\r\\\\nold campaigner will accept such shelter gladly, notwithstanding the\\\\r\\\\napparent insignificances of its cause.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShelter from the Sky.--The shelter of a wall is only sufficient against\\\\r\\\\nwind or driving rain; we require a roof to shield us against vertical\\\\r\\\\nrain, and against dew, or what is much the same thing, against the cold\\\\r\\\\nof a clear blue sky on a still night. The temperature of the heavens is\\\\r\\\\nknown pretty accurately, by more than one method of calculation: it is\\\\r\\\\n-239 degrees Fahr.; the greatest cold felt in the Arctic regions being\\\\r\\\\nabout -40 degrees Fahr. If the night be cloudy, each cloud is a roof to\\\\r\\\\nkeep off the cold; if it be clear, we are exposed to the full chill of\\\\r\\\\nthe blue sky, with only such alleviation as the warming and the\\\\r\\\\nnon-conducting powers of the atmosphere may afford. The effect is greater\\\\r\\\\nthan most people would credit. The uppermost layer of the earth, or\\\\r\\\\nwhatever may be lying exposed upon it, is called upon to part with a\\\\r\\\\ngreat quantity of heat. If it so happen that the uppermost layer is of a\\\\r\\\\nnon-conducting nature, the heat abstracted from it will be poorly\\\\r\\\\nresupplied by communication from the lower ones. Again, if the night be a\\\\r\\\\nvery calm one, there will be no supply of warmth from fresh currents of\\\\r\\\\nair falling down upon it. Hence, in the treble event of a clear blue sky,\\\\r\\\\na non-conducting soil, and a perfectly still night, we are liable to have\\\\r\\\\ngreat cold on the surface of the ground. This is shared by a thin layer\\\\r\\\\nof air that immediately rests upon it; while at each successive inch in\\\\r\\\\nheight, the air becomes more nearly of its proper temperature. A vast\\\\r\\\\nnumber of experiments have been made by Mr. Glaisher on this subject\\\\r\\\\n('Phil. Trans.' 1847), the upshot of which is that a thermometer laid on\\\\r\\\\ngrass, under a blue sky on a calm night, marks on an average 8 degrees\\\\r\\\\nFahr. colder than one 4 feet above it; 1 inch above grass, 5 1/2 degrees;\\\\r\\\\n1 foot, 1 degrees; 4 feet, 1/2 degrees; on gravel and sand the\\\\r\\\\ndifferences are only about one-third as much. Sheep have a practical\\\\r\\\\nknowledge of these differences. Often, in an early walk on dewy mornings,\\\\r\\\\nI see all the sheep in Hyde Park bivouacked on the gravel walks of Rotten\\\\r\\\\nRow. The above figures are the results of experiments made in England,\\\\r\\\\nwhere the air is always moist, and the formation of dew, while it\\\\r\\\\ntestifies to the cold of the night, assists largely to moderate it. In\\\\r\\\\narid climates the chill would be far greater; such would also be the case\\\\r\\\\nat high elevations. One of Mr. Glaisher's experiments showed a difference\\\\r\\\\nof no less than 28 degrees between the cold on the ground and that at 8\\\\r\\\\nfeet high. This might often be rivalled in an elevated desert, as in that\\\\r\\\\nof Mongolia. Hence the value of the protection of a roof and of a raised\\\\r\\\\nsleeping-place, to a man sleeping under a blue sky in still weather,\\\\r\\\\nadmits of easy interpretation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVarious Methods of Bivouacking.--Unprotected.--Mr. Shaw, the traveller\\\\r\\\\nin Thibet, says:--\\\\\\\"My companion and I walked on to keep ourselves warm,\\\\r\\\\nbut halting at sunset, had to sit and freeze several hours before the\\\\r\\\\nthings came up. The best way of keeping warm on such an occasion, is to\\\\r\\\\nsquat down, kneeling against a bank, resting your head on the bank, and\\\\r\\\\nnearly between your knees. Then tuck your overcoat in, all round you,\\\\r\\\\nover head and all; and if you are lucky, and there is not too much wind,\\\\r\\\\nyou will make a little atmosphere of your own inside the covering, which\\\\r\\\\nwill be snug in comparison with the outside air. Your feet suffer\\\\r\\\\nchiefly, but you learn to tie yourself into a kind of knot, bringing as\\\\r\\\\nmany surfaces of your body together as possible. I have passed whole\\\\r\\\\nnights in this kneeling position, and slept well; whereas I should not\\\\r\\\\nhave got a wink had I been stretched at full length with such a scanty\\\\r\\\\ncovering as a great-coat.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBushes.--I have shown that the main object before sleeping out at night\\\\r\\\\nis to secure a long wind-tight wall, and that the next is to obtain a\\\\r\\\\nroof. Both these objects may be attained by pleachingtwo or three small\\\\r\\\\nneighbouring bushes into one; or branches may be torn off elsewhere and\\\\r\\\\ninterwoven between the bushes. A few leafy boughs, cut and stuck into the\\\\r\\\\nground, with their tops leaning over the bed, and secured in that\\\\r\\\\nposition by other boughs, wattled-in horizontally, give great protection.\\\\r\\\\nLong grass, etc., should be plucked and strewn against them to make them\\\\r\\\\nas wind-tight as possible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWalls.--A pile of saddle-bags and other travelling gear may be made into\\\\r\\\\na good screen against the wind; and travellers usually arrange them with\\\\r\\\\nthat intention. Walls of stone may be built as a support to cloths, whose\\\\r\\\\noffice it is to render the walls wind-tight, and also by lapping over\\\\r\\\\ntheir top, to form a partial roof. We have already spoken of a broad sod\\\\r\\\\nof turf propped up on edge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The Thibetan traveller cares for no roof overhead if he can shelter\\\\r\\\\nhimself from the wind behind a three-foot wall. Hence the numerous little\\\\r\\\\nenclosures clustered together like cells of a honeycomb at every\\\\r\\\\nhalting-place, with one side always raised against the prevailing wind.\\\\r\\\\n(Shaw.) These walls are built round shallow pits, each with its rough\\\\r\\\\nfireplace in the middle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCloths.--Any cloth may be made to give shelter by an arrangement like\\\\r\\\\nthat in the sketch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of cloth shelter].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe corners of the cloth should be secured by simple hitches in the rope,\\\\r\\\\nand never by knots. The former are sufficient for all purposes of\\\\r\\\\nsecurity, but the latter will jam, and you may have to injure both cloth\\\\r\\\\nand string to get them loose again. It is convenient to pin the sides of\\\\r\\\\nthe cloth with a skewer round the ropes. Any strip of wood makes a\\\\r\\\\nskewer. Earth should be banked against the lowest edge of the cloth, to\\\\r\\\\nkeep out the wind, and to prevent its flapping. The sticks may, on an\\\\r\\\\nemergency, be replaced by faggots of brushwood, by guns, or by ropes\\\\r\\\\ncarried down from the overhanging branches of a large tree. (For a sail\\\\r\\\\nsupported by oars, see \\\\\\\"Sail Tent\\\\\\\" p. 108.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFremont, the American traveller bivouacked as follows:--His rifles were\\\\r\\\\ntied together near the muzzles, the butts resting on the ground widely\\\\r\\\\napart; a knife was laid on the rope that tied them together, to cut it in\\\\r\\\\ncase of an alarm; over this extempore framework was thrown a large\\\\r\\\\nindia-rubber cloth, with which he covered his packs when on the road; it\\\\r\\\\nmade a cover sufficiently large to receive about half of his bed, and was\\\\r\\\\na place of shelter for his instruments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGordon Cumming.--The following extract is from Mr. Gordon Cumming's book\\\\r\\\\non Africa: it describes the preparations of a practised traveller for a\\\\r\\\\nshort excursion from his wagons away into the bush. \\\\\\\"I had at length got\\\\r\\\\ninto the way of making myself tolerably comfortable in the field, and\\\\r\\\\nfrom this date I seldom went in quest of elephants without the following\\\\r\\\\nimpedimenta, i.e. a large blanket, which I folded and secured before my\\\\r\\\\nsaddle as a dragoon does his cloak, and two leather sacks, containing a\\\\r\\\\nflannel shirt, warm trousers, and a woollen night-cap, spare ammunition,\\\\r\\\\nwashing-rod, coffee, bread, sugar, pepper and salt, dried meat, a wooden\\\\r\\\\nbowl, and a tea-spoon. These sacks were carried on the shoulders of the\\\\r\\\\nnatives, for which service I remunerated them with beads. They also\\\\r\\\\ncarried my coffee-kettle, two calabashes of water, two American axes, and\\\\r\\\\ntwo sickles, which I used every evening to cut grass for my bed, and\\\\r\\\\nlikewise for my horses to eat throughout the night; and my after-rider\\\\r\\\\ncarried extra ammunition and a spare rifle.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nImportance of Comfort.--To conclude these general hints, let the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller, when out in trying weather, work hard at making his\\\\r\\\\nsleeping-place perfectly dry and comfortable; he should not cease until\\\\r\\\\nhe is convinced that it will withstand the chill of the early morning,\\\\r\\\\nwhen the heat of the yesterday's sun is exhausted, and that of the coming\\\\r\\\\nsun has not begun to be felt. It is wretched beyond expression for a man\\\\r\\\\nto lie shivering beneath a scanty covering and to feel the night air\\\\r\\\\nbecome hourly more raw, while his life-blood has less power to withstand\\\\r\\\\nit; and to think, self-reproachfully, how different would have been his\\\\r\\\\nsituation if he had simply had forethought and energy enough to cut and\\\\r\\\\ndraw twice the quantity of firewood, and to spend an extra half-hour in\\\\r\\\\nlabouring to make himself a snugger berth. The omission once made becomes\\\\r\\\\nirreparable; for in the cold of a pitiless night he has hardly sufficient\\\\r\\\\nstamina to rise and face the weather, and the darkness makes him unable\\\\r\\\\nto cope with his difficulties.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBivouac in Special Localities.--Encampment in Forests.--A clump of trees\\\\r\\\\nyields wonderful shelter. The Swedes have a proverb that \\\\\\\"the forest is\\\\r\\\\nthe poor man's jacket.\\\\\\\" In fir-woods there is great facility in making\\\\r\\\\nwarm encampments; for a young tree, when it is felled, yields both poles\\\\r\\\\nto support branches for shields against weather, and finer cuttings for\\\\r\\\\nflooring above the snow or damp. A common plan is to support a cross-bar\\\\r\\\\nby two uprights, as shown in the figure; against this cross-bar a number\\\\r\\\\nof poles are made to lean; on the back of the poles abundance of fir\\\\r\\\\nbranches are laid horizontally; and lastly, on the back of these are\\\\r\\\\nanother set of leaning poles, in order to secure them by their weight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of pole shelter].\\\\r\\\\nOn Bare Plains.--Avoid sleeping in slight hollows during clear still\\\\r\\\\nweather. The cold stratum of air, of which I spoke in the section of\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Shelter from the Sky,\\\\\\\" pours down into them, like water from the\\\\r\\\\nsurrounding plain, and stagnates. Spring frosts are always more severely\\\\r\\\\nfelt in hollows. Therefore, in a broad level plain, especially if the\\\\r\\\\nnight be clear and calm, look out for some slightly rising ground for an\\\\r\\\\nencampment. The chilled stratum of air drains from off it, and is\\\\r\\\\nreplaced by warmer air. Horses and cattle, as the night sets in, always\\\\r\\\\ndraw up to these higher grounds, which rise like islands through the sea\\\\r\\\\nof mist that covers the plain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWalls have been built for shelter against the wind, on a bare sandy\\\\r\\\\nplain, by taking empty bags, filling them with sand, and then building\\\\r\\\\nthem up as if they had been stones.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuried, or in Holes.--A European can live through a bitter night, on a\\\\r\\\\nperfectly dry sandy plain, without any clothes besides what he has on, if\\\\r\\\\nhe buries his body pretty deeply in the sand, keeping only his head above\\\\r\\\\nground. It is a usual habit of the naked natives in Australia to do so,\\\\r\\\\nand not an unfrequent one of the Hottentots of South Africa. Mr. Moffat\\\\r\\\\nrecords with grateful surprise how he passed a night, of which he had\\\\r\\\\ngloomy forebodings, in real comfort, even luxury, by adopting this\\\\r\\\\nmethod. A man may be as comfortable in a burrow as in a den. I shall\\\\r\\\\nspeak of underground houses under \\\\\\\"Hutting;\\\\\\\" and for the present will\\\\r\\\\nonly mention that, in arid countries, dry wells, dug by natives and\\\\r\\\\npartially choked by drifted sand, are often to be met with. They are\\\\r\\\\ngenerally found near existing watering-places, where they have been\\\\r\\\\nsuperseded by others, better placed and deeper. Now, there are few warmer\\\\r\\\\nsleeping-places than one of these dry wells; a small fire is easily kept\\\\r\\\\nburning at the bottom, and the top may be partially roofed over.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn Ashes of Camp Fire.--A few chill hours may be got over, in a plain\\\\r\\\\nthat affords no other shelter, by nestling among the ashes of a recently\\\\r\\\\nburnt-out camp fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWarm Carcases.--In Napoleon's retreat, after his campaign in Russia, many\\\\r\\\\na soldier saved or prolonged his life by creeping within the warm and\\\\r\\\\nreeking carcase of a horse that had died by the way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the water-side.--A stony beach makes a fine dry encamping-place, and\\\\r\\\\nhas this advantage, that it makes it impossible for marauders to creep up\\\\r\\\\nunheard. But the immediate neighbourhood of fresh water is objectionable,\\\\r\\\\nfor, besides being exposed to malaria and mosquitoes, the night air is\\\\r\\\\nmore cold and penetrating by its side, than at one or two hundred yards'\\\\r\\\\ndistance from it. (I will speak of walls of rushes and reeds, under\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Huts.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy Rocks.--In the cruel climate of Thibet, Dr. Hooker tells us that it is\\\\r\\\\nthe habit to encamp close to some large rock, because a rock absorbs heat\\\\r\\\\nall day, and parts with it but slowly during the night-time. It is,\\\\r\\\\ntherefore, a reservoir of warmth when the sun is down, and its\\\\r\\\\nneighbourhood is coveted in the night-time. Owing to the same cause,\\\\r\\\\nacting in the opposite direction, the shadow of a broad rock is\\\\r\\\\npeculiarly cool and grateful, during the heat of the day, in a thirsty\\\\r\\\\nland.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn Heather.--Mr. St. John tells us of an excellent way in which Highland\\\\r\\\\npoachers, when in a party usually pass frosty nights on the moor-side.\\\\r\\\\nThey cut quantities of heather, and strew part of it as a bed on the\\\\r\\\\nground; then all the party lie down, side by side, excepting one man\\\\r\\\\nwhose place among the rest is kept vacant for him. His business is to\\\\r\\\\nspread plaids upon them as they lie, and to heap up the remainder of the\\\\r\\\\nheather upon the plaids. This being accomplished, the man wriggles and\\\\r\\\\nworks himself into the gap that has been left for him in the midst of his\\\\r\\\\ncomrades.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of sleeping arrangement].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn Snow.--I shall have to describe snow-houses and snow-walls covered\\\\r\\\\nwith sail-cloth, under \\\\\\\"Huts.\\\\\\\" Here I will speak of more simple\\\\r\\\\narrangements. Dr. Kane says:--\\\\\\\"We afterwards learnt to modify and reduce\\\\r\\\\nour travelling-gear, and found that in direct proportion to its\\\\r\\\\nsimplicity and to our apparent privation of articles of supposed\\\\r\\\\nnecessity, were our actual comfort and practical efficiency. Step by\\\\r\\\\nstep, as long as our Arctic service continued, we went on reducing our\\\\r\\\\nsledging outfit, until we at last came to the Esquimaux ultimatum of\\\\r\\\\nsimplicity--raw meat and a fur bag.\\\\\\\" Lieut. Cresswell, R.N., who, having\\\\r\\\\nbeen detached from Captain McClure's ship in 1853, was the first officer\\\\r\\\\nwho ever accomplished the famous North-West passage, gave the following\\\\r\\\\ngraphic account of the routine of his journeying, in a speech at\\\\r\\\\nLynn:--\\\\\\\"You must be aware that in Arctic travelling you must depend\\\\r\\\\nentirely on your own resources. You have not a single thing else to\\\\r\\\\ndepend on except snow-water: no produce of the country, nor firewood, or\\\\r\\\\ncoals, or anything off the sort; and whatever you have to take, to\\\\r\\\\nsustain you for the journey, you must carry or drag. It is found by\\\\r\\\\nexperience more easy to drag it on sledges than to carry it. The plan we\\\\r\\\\nadopt is this:--we have a sledge generally manned by about six or ten\\\\r\\\\nmen, which we load with provisions, with tents, and all requisites for\\\\r\\\\ntravelling, simple cooking utensils, spirits-of-wine for cooking, etc.,\\\\r\\\\nand start off. The quantity of people can generally drag over the ice is\\\\r\\\\nforty days' provisions; that gives about 200 lbs. weight to each. After\\\\r\\\\nstarting from the ship, and having travelled a certain number of\\\\r\\\\nhours--generally ten or eleven--we encamp for the night, or rather for\\\\r\\\\nthe day, because it is considered better to travel at night and sleep at\\\\r\\\\nday, on account of the glare of the sun on the snow. We used to travel\\\\r\\\\njourneys of about ten hours, and then encamp, light our spirits-of-wine,\\\\r\\\\nput our kettle on it to thaw our snow-water, and after we had had our\\\\r\\\\nsupper--just a piece of pemmican and a glass of water--we were glad to\\\\r\\\\nsmoke our pipes and turn into bed. The first thing we did, after pitching\\\\r\\\\nthe tent, was to lay a sort of macintosh covering over the snow; on this\\\\r\\\\na piece of buffalo robe was stretched. Each man and officer had a blanket\\\\r\\\\nsewn up in the form of a bag; and into these we used to jump, much in the\\\\r\\\\nsame way as you may see a boy do in a sack. We lay down head and feet,\\\\r\\\\nthe next person to me having his head to my feet, and his feet to my\\\\r\\\\nhead, so that we lay like herrings in a barrel. After this, we covered\\\\r\\\\nourselves with skin, spreading them over the whole of us; and the closer\\\\r\\\\nwe got, the better, as there was more warmth. We lay till the morning,\\\\r\\\\nand then the process was the same again.\\\\\\\" It appears that people may bury\\\\r\\\\nthemselves in snow, and want neither air nor warmth. I have never made\\\\r\\\\nthe experiment; but have read of numerous instances of people falling\\\\r\\\\ninto snow-drifts, and not being extricated for many days, and when at\\\\r\\\\nlength they were taken out, they never seem to have complained of cold,\\\\r\\\\nor any other sufferings than those of hunger and of anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHUTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHuts and Snow-Houses.--In making a depï¿½t, it is usual to build a house;\\\\r\\\\noften the men must pass weeks in inactivity, and they had better spend\\\\r\\\\ntheir time in making their quarters comfortable than in idleness.\\\\r\\\\nWhatever huts are used by the natives are sure, if made with extra care,\\\\r\\\\nto be good enough for European travellers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLog-huts.--In building log-huts, four poles are planted in the ground, to\\\\r\\\\ncorrespond to the four corners; against these, logs are piled one above\\\\r\\\\nanother as in the drawing below; they are so deeply notched where their\\\\r\\\\nends are crossed, that the adjacent sides are firmly dovetailed. When the\\\\r\\\\nwalls are entirely completed, the door and windows are chopped out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of cabin].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe spaces between the logs must be caulked with moss, etc., or the\\\\r\\\\nlog-cabin will be little better than a log-cage. It requires a great many\\\\r\\\\nlogs to make a hut; for, supposing the walls to be 8 feet high, and the\\\\r\\\\ntrees to average 8 inches in diameter, twelve trees would be required to\\\\r\\\\nbuild up one side, or forty-eight for all four walls. Other timber would\\\\r\\\\nalso be wanted for the roof.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUnderground Huts are used in all quarters of the globe. The experience of\\\\r\\\\nour troops when encamped before Sebastopol during an inclement season\\\\r\\\\ntold strongly in their favour. Their timely adoption was the salvation of\\\\r\\\\nthe British army. They are essentially, nothing else than holes in the\\\\r\\\\nground, roofed over, fig. 1.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of roof and geometrical measure].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe shape and size of the hole corresponds to that of the roof it may be\\\\r\\\\npossible to procure for it; its depth is no greater than requisite for\\\\r\\\\nsitting or standing. If the roof has a pitch of 2 feet in the middle, the\\\\r\\\\ndepth of the hole need not exceed 4 1/2 feet. In the Crimea, the holes\\\\r\\\\nwere rectangular, and were roofed like huts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhere there is a steep hillside, a a', fig. 2, an underground hut, b, is\\\\r\\\\neasily contrived; because branches laid over its top, along the surface\\\\r\\\\nof the ground, have sufficient pitch to throw off the rain. Of course the\\\\r\\\\nearth must be removed from a', at the place intended for the doorway.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReed Huts.--The reed huts of the Affej Arabs, and other inhabitants of\\\\r\\\\nthe Chaldean marshes, are shaped like wagon-roofs, and are constructed of\\\\r\\\\nsemicircular ribs of reeds, planted in the ground, one behind the other,\\\\r\\\\nat equal distances apart; each rib being a faggot of reeds of 2 feet in\\\\r\\\\ndiameter. For strength, they are bound round every yard with twisted\\\\r\\\\nbands of reeds. When this framework has been erected, it is covered with\\\\r\\\\ntwo or three sheets of fine reed matting (see \\\\\\\"Matting\\\\\\\"), which forms a\\\\r\\\\ndwelling impervious to rain. Some of the chiefs' huts are as much as 40\\\\r\\\\nfeet long, and 12 high; the other huts are considerably smaller. Many of\\\\r\\\\nthese reed dwellings are contained in compounds enclosed by lofty reed\\\\r\\\\nfences; the reeds being planted upright, and simply strung together by a\\\\r\\\\nthread run through them, as they stand side by side. (See \\\\\\\"Straw and Reed\\\\r\\\\nWalls.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow-houses.--Few travellers have habitually made snow-houses, except Sir\\\\r\\\\nJ. Franklin's party and that of Dr. Rae. Great praises are bestowed on\\\\r\\\\ntheir comfort by all travellers, but skill and practice are required in\\\\r\\\\nbuilding them. The mode of erection of these dome-shaped buildings is as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--It is to be understood that compact, underlying snow is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary for the floor of the hut; and that the looser textured, upper\\\\r\\\\nlayer of snow, is used to build the house. First, select and mark out the\\\\r\\\\ncircular plot on which the hut is to be raised. Then, cut out of that\\\\r\\\\nplot, with knives, deep slices of snow, 6 inches wide, 3 feet long, and\\\\r\\\\nof a depth equal to that of the layer of loose snow, say one or two feet.\\\\r\\\\nThese slices are to be of a curved shape, so as to form a circular ring\\\\r\\\\nwhen placed on their edges, and of a suitable radius for the first row of\\\\r\\\\nsnow-bricks. Other slices are cut on the same principle for the\\\\r\\\\nsucceeding rows; but when the domed roof has to be made, the snow-bricks\\\\r\\\\nmust be cut with the necessary double curvature. A conical plug fills up\\\\r\\\\nthe centre of the dome. Loose snow is next heaped over the house, to fill\\\\r\\\\nup crevices. Lastly a doorway is cut out with knives; also a window,\\\\r\\\\nwhich is glazed with a sheet of the purest ice at hand. For inside\\\\r\\\\naccommodation there should be a pillar or two of snow to support the\\\\r\\\\nlamps.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow Walls with Tenting for their Roofs.--Sir L. McClintock says:--\\\\\\\"We\\\\r\\\\ntravelled each day until dusk, and then were occupied for a couple of\\\\r\\\\nhours in building our snow-hut. The four walls were run up until 5 1/2\\\\r\\\\nfeet high, inclining inwards as much as possible, over these our tent was\\\\r\\\\nlaid to form a roof. We could not afford the time necessary to construct\\\\r\\\\na dome of snow. Our equipment consisted of a very small brown-holland\\\\r\\\\ntent, macintosh floor-cloth and felt robes; besides this, each man had a\\\\r\\\\nbag of double blanketing, and a pair of fur boots, to sleep in. We wore\\\\r\\\\nmocassins over the pieces of blanketing in which our feet were wrapped\\\\r\\\\nup, and, with the exception of a change of this foot-gear, carried no\\\\r\\\\nspare clothes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"When we halted for the night, Thompson and I usually sawed out the\\\\r\\\\nblocks of compact snow, and carried them to Petersen, who acted as the\\\\r\\\\nmaster-mason in building the hut. The hour-and-a-half or two hours\\\\r\\\\nusually employed in erecting the edifice was the most disagreeable part\\\\r\\\\nof the day's labour; for, in addition to being already well tired and\\\\r\\\\ndesiring repose, we became thoroughly chilled while standing about. The\\\\r\\\\ndogs were then fed, then the sledge unpacked, and everything carried into\\\\r\\\\nit. The door was now blocked up with snow, the cooking-lamp lighted,\\\\r\\\\nfoot-gear changed, diary writing up, watches wound, sleeping-bags\\\\r\\\\nwriggled into, pipes lighted, and the merits of the various dogs\\\\r\\\\ndiscussed, until supper was ready; the supper swallowed, the upper robe\\\\r\\\\nor coverlet pulled over, and then to sleep. Next morning came breakfast,\\\\r\\\\na struggle to get into frozen mocassins, after which the sledges were\\\\r\\\\npacked, and another day's march commenced. In these little huts we\\\\r\\\\nusually slept warm enough, although latterly, when our blankets and\\\\r\\\\nclothes became loaded with ice, we felt the cold severely. When our low\\\\r\\\\ndoorway was carefully blocked up with snow, and the cooking-lamp alight,\\\\r\\\\nthe temperature quickly rose, so that the walls became glazed and our\\\\r\\\\nbedding thawed; but the cooking over, or the doorway partially opened, it\\\\r\\\\nas quickly fell again, so that it was impossible to sleep, or even to\\\\r\\\\nhold one's pannikin of tea without putting mits on, so intense was the\\\\r\\\\ncold.\\\\\\\"--Sir L. McClintock is here speaking of a temperature of -39\\\\r\\\\ndegrees Fahr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaterials for building Huts.--The materials whence the walls and roofs of\\\\r\\\\nhuts may be constructed are very numerous: there is hardly any place\\\\r\\\\nwhich does not furnish one or other of them. Those principally in use are\\\\r\\\\nas follows:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWattle-and-daub, to be executed neatly, required well-shaped and flexible\\\\r\\\\nsticks; but a hut may be constructed much like the sketch (see p. 120) of\\\\r\\\\nthe way of \\\\\\\"Drying Clothes.\\\\\\\" It is made by planting in the ground a\\\\r\\\\nnumber of bare sticks, 4 feet long, and 1 foot apart, bending their tops\\\\r\\\\ntogether, lashing them fast with string or strips of bark, and wattling\\\\r\\\\nthem judiciously here and there, by means of other boughs, laid\\\\r\\\\nhorizontally. Then, by heaping leaves--and especially broad pieces of\\\\r\\\\nbark, if you can get them--over all, and banking up the earth on either\\\\r\\\\nside, pretty high, an excellent kennel is made. If daubed over with mud,\\\\r\\\\nclay, or cattle-dung, the hut becomes more secure against the weather. To\\\\r\\\\nproceed a step further:--as many poles may be planted in the ground as\\\\r\\\\nsticks have been employed in making the roof; and then the roof may be\\\\r\\\\nlifted bodily in the air, and lashed to the top of the poles, each stick\\\\r\\\\nto its corresponding pole. This sort of structure is very common among\\\\r\\\\nsavages.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor methods of digging holes in which to plant the hut-poles, see the\\\\r\\\\nchapter on \\\\\\\"Wells.\\\\\\\" The holes made in the way I have there explained are\\\\r\\\\nfar better than those dug with spades; for they disturb no more of the\\\\r\\\\nhardened ground than is necessary for the insertion of the palisades. To\\\\r\\\\njam a pole tightly in its place, wedges of wood should be driven in at\\\\r\\\\nits side, and earth rammed down between the wedges.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPalisades are excellent as walls or as enclosures. They are erected of\\\\r\\\\nvast lengths, by savages wholly destitute of tools, both for the purposes\\\\r\\\\nof fortification and also for completing lines of pitfalls across wide\\\\r\\\\nvalleys. the pitfalls occupy gaps left in the palisading. The savages\\\\r\\\\nburn down the trees in the following manner:--a party of men go to the\\\\r\\\\nforest, and light small fires round the roots of the trees they propose\\\\r\\\\nto fell. the fires are prevented from flaming upwards by the judicious\\\\r\\\\napplication of leaves, etc. When the fire has eaten a little way into the\\\\r\\\\ntree, the man who watches it scrapes the fire aside and knocks away the\\\\r\\\\ncharred wood, exposing a fresh surface for fire to act upon, and then\\\\r\\\\nreplaces the burning embers. A single man may easily attend to a dozen\\\\r\\\\ntrees, and, indeed, to many more, if the night be calm. Some hours elapse\\\\r\\\\nbefore the trees actually fall. Their tops and branches are burnt off as\\\\r\\\\nthey lie on the ground. The poles being thus procured for the palisading,\\\\r\\\\nthey are carried to the required place, where holes are dug for their\\\\r\\\\nreception, on the principle described in \\\\\\\"Wells,\\\\\\\" to which I have just\\\\r\\\\nalluded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStraw or Reed Walls of the following kind are very effective, and they\\\\r\\\\nhave the advantage of requiring a minimum of string (or substitute for\\\\r\\\\nstring) in their manufacture. The straw, reeds, or herbage, of almost any\\\\r\\\\ndescription, is simply nipped between two pairs of long sticks, which are\\\\r\\\\nrespectively tied together at their ends, and at a sufficient number of\\\\r\\\\nintermediate places. The whole is neatly squared and trimmed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of straw walls].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA few of these would give good help in finishing the roof or walls of a\\\\r\\\\nhouse. They can be made moveable, so as to suit the wind, shade, and\\\\r\\\\naspect. Even the hut door can be made on this principle. In reedy\\\\r\\\\ncountries where there are no sticks, thin faggots of reeds are used in\\\\r\\\\ntheir place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBark.--Bark is universally used in Australia for roofs of huts and\\\\r\\\\ntemporary buildings; the colonists learnt the use of it from the natives,\\\\r\\\\nand some trees, at least, in every forest-country might very probably be\\\\r\\\\nfound as well fitted for that purpose as those in Australia. The bark may\\\\r\\\\nbe easily removed, only when the sap is well up in the tree, but a\\\\r\\\\nskilful person will manage to procure bark at all seasons of the year,\\\\r\\\\nexcept in the coldest winter months; and even then he will light on some\\\\r\\\\ntree, from the sunny side of which he can strip broad pieces. The process\\\\r\\\\nof bark-stripping is simply to cut two rings right round the tree\\\\r\\\\n(usually from 6 to 9 feet apart), and one vertical slit to join them;\\\\r\\\\nstarting from the slit, and chipping away step by step on either side,\\\\r\\\\nthe whole cylinder of bark is removed. The larger the tree, the better;\\\\r\\\\nfor if the tree is less than 18 inches, or so, in diameter, the bark is\\\\r\\\\napt to break when flattened out. When stripped for huts, it is laid on\\\\r\\\\nthe ground for some days to dry, being flattened out on its face, and a\\\\r\\\\nfew stones or logs put on it. the ordinary bark of gum-trees is about\\\\r\\\\nhalf an inch to three-eighths thick, so that a large sheet is very heavy.\\\\r\\\\nMost exploring expeditions are accompanied by a black, whose dexterity in\\\\r\\\\nstripping bark for a wet night is invaluable, as if the bark will \\\\\\\"come\\\\r\\\\noff\\\\\\\" well, he can procure enough of it in an hour's time to make a\\\\r\\\\nshelter for a large party.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMats can be woven with ease when there is abundance of string, or some\\\\r\\\\nequivalent for it (see \\\\\\\"String\\\\\\\"), in the following manner:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of loom].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA, B, are two pegs driven into the ground and standing about a foot out\\\\r\\\\nof it. A stake, A B, is lashed across them; a row of pegs, E, are driven\\\\r\\\\ninto the ground, parallel to A, B, and about 6 inches apart. Two sets of\\\\r\\\\nstrings are then tied to A B; one set are fastened by their loose ends\\\\r\\\\ninto clefts, in the pegs E, and the other set are fastened to the stick,\\\\r\\\\nC D. If there be ten strings in all, then 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, are tied to C D,\\\\r\\\\nand 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, to A B. By alternately raising and depressing C D,\\\\r\\\\nand by pushing in a handful of rushes between the two sets of strings\\\\r\\\\nafter each of its movements, and, finally, by patting them home with a\\\\r\\\\nflat stick, this rough sort of weaving is carried on very successfully.\\\\r\\\\nMats are also plaited in breadths, and the breadths are stitched\\\\r\\\\ntogether, side by side. Or a thicker kind of mat may be made by taking a\\\\r\\\\nwisp of straw and working it in the same way in which straw beehives are\\\\r\\\\nconstructed. Straw is worked more easily after being damped and beaten\\\\r\\\\nwith a mallet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMalay hitch.--I know no better name for the wonderfully simple way (shown\\\\r\\\\nin the figure) of attaching together wisps of straw, rods, laths, reeds,\\\\r\\\\nplanks, poles, or anything of the kind, into a secure and flexible mat;\\\\r\\\\nthe sails used in the far East are made in this way, and the moveable\\\\r\\\\ndecks of vessels are made of bamboos, joined together with a similar but\\\\r\\\\nrather more complicated stitch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of fastening].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI may remark that soldiers might be trained to a great deal of hutting\\\\r\\\\npractice in a very inexpensive way, if they were drilled at putting\\\\r\\\\ntogether huts, whose roofs and walls were made of planks lashed together\\\\r\\\\nby this simple hitch, and whose supports were short scaffolding poles\\\\r\\\\nplanted in deep holes, dug, as explained in the chapter on \\\\\\\"Wells,\\\\\\\" with\\\\r\\\\nthe hand and a small stick. The poles, planks, and cords might be used\\\\r\\\\nover and over again for an indefinite time. Further, bedsteads could be\\\\r\\\\nmade in a similar way, by short cross-planks lashed together, and resting\\\\r\\\\non a framework of horizontal poles, lashed to uprights planted in the\\\\r\\\\nground. The soldier's bedding would not be injured by being used on these\\\\r\\\\nbedsteads, as much as if it were laid on the bare ground. Kinds of\\\\r\\\\ndesigns and experiments in hutting could be practised without expense in\\\\r\\\\nthis simple way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTarpaulings are very suitable for roofs. Those made after the method used\\\\r\\\\nby sailors are much superior to others in softness and durability. The\\\\r\\\\nplan is as follows:--As soon as the canvas has been sewn together, it is\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly wetted with sea-water; and, while still wet, it is smeared\\\\r\\\\nover on one of its sides with tar and grease, boiled together--about two\\\\r\\\\nparts tar and one of grease. After being hung up till it is dry, it is\\\\r\\\\nturned; and the other side, being a second time well wetted, is at once\\\\r\\\\npainted over with the tar and grease, just as the first side had been\\\\r\\\\nbefore. The sailors say that \\\\\\\"the tar dries in, as the water dries out;\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\na saying which I confess I cannot understand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Materials.--I will merely mention these by name, for they require\\\\r\\\\nno explanation. They are fascines or faggots; bricks, sun-dried or baked\\\\r\\\\nin the oven; turf; stones; and bags or mats, filled with sand or shingle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhitewash is lime and water. Lime is made by burning limestone, chalk,\\\\r\\\\nshells, or coral in a simple furnace.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRoofs.--Thatching.--After the framework of the roof has been made, the\\\\r\\\\nthatcher begins at the bottom, and ties a row of bundles of straw, side\\\\r\\\\nby side, on to the framework. Then he begins a second row, allowing the\\\\r\\\\nends of the bundles composing it to overlap the heads of those in the\\\\r\\\\nfirst row.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWood-shingles are tile-shaped slices of wood, easily cut from fir-trees.\\\\r\\\\nThey are used for roofing, on the same principle as tiles or slates.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFloors.--Concrete for floors, is made of eight parts large pebbles, four\\\\r\\\\nparts river-sand, and one part lime (to make lime, see \\\\\\\"Whitewash\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\nCow-dung and ashes make a hard, dry, and clean floor; such as is used for\\\\r\\\\na threshing-floor. Ox blood and fine clay kneaded together are excellent.\\\\r\\\\nBoth these latter compositions are in use in all hot dry countries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWindows.--A window, or rather a hole in the wall, may be rudely shuttered\\\\r\\\\nby a stick run through loops made out of wisps of grass. In hot weather,\\\\r\\\\nthe windows of the hutmay be loosely stuffed with grass, which, when\\\\r\\\\nwatered, makes the hut cooler.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGlass, to cut.--Glass cannot be cut with any certainty, without a\\\\r\\\\ndiamond; but it may be shaped and reduced to any size by gradually\\\\r\\\\nchipping, or rather biting, away at its edges with a key, if the slit\\\\r\\\\nbetween the wards of the key be just large enough to admit the pane of\\\\r\\\\nglass easily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitutes for glass.--These are waxed or oiled paper or cloth, bladder,\\\\r\\\\nfish-membranes, talc, and horn. (See \\\\\\\"Horn.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSLEEPING-BAGS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSleeping-bags.--Knapsack Bags.--These have been used for the last\\\\r\\\\ntwenty-five years by the French 'douaniers', who watch the\\\\r\\\\nmountain-passes of the Pyrenean frontier. The bags are made of sheepskin,\\\\r\\\\nwith the wool inside. When not in use they are folded up and buckled with\\\\r\\\\nfive buckles into the shape of a somewhat bulky knapsack (p. 152), which\\\\r\\\\nthe recent occupant may shoulder and walk away with.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe accompanying sketches are drawn to scale. They were made from the\\\\r\\\\nsleeping-bag belonging to a man 5 feet 6 inches in height; the scale\\\\r\\\\nshould therefore be lengthened for a taller person, but the breadth seems\\\\r\\\\nample. Its weight was exactly seven pounds. The douaniers post themselves\\\\r\\\\non watch more or less immersed in these bags. They lie out in wet and\\\\r\\\\nsnow, and find them impervious to both. When they sleep, they get quite\\\\r\\\\ninside them, stuff their cloaks between their throats and the bag, and\\\\r\\\\nlet its flap cover their faces. It is easy enough for them to extricate\\\\r\\\\nthemselves; they can do so almost with a bound. The Spanish Custom-house\\\\r\\\\nofficers who watch the same frontier, use their cloaks and other wraps,\\\\r\\\\nwhich are far more weighty, and far inferior in warmth and protection to\\\\r\\\\nthe bags. I described these knapsack bags in 'Vacation Tourists for\\\\r\\\\n1860,' p. 449, and I subsequently had a macintosh bag lined with drugget,\\\\r\\\\nmade on the same principle. I had a hood to it, and also the means of\\\\r\\\\nbuttoning it loosely under my chin, to make myself watertight during\\\\r\\\\nheavy rain. In that bag I passed many nights of very trying weather. On\\\\r\\\\none instance, I selected a hilltop in Switzerland, on the way from\\\\r\\\\nChambery to the Dent du Midi, during a violent and long-continued\\\\r\\\\nthunderstorm. The storm began above my head, then slowly sank to my\\\\r\\\\nlevel, and finally subsided below me. Many Alpine travellers, notably Mr.\\\\r\\\\nPacke and Mr. Tuckett, have adopted these bags, and used them\\\\r\\\\ncontinually. Macintosh is certainly oppressive to sleep in, though less\\\\r\\\\nso than might have been expected, as the half-unconscious fidgeting of\\\\r\\\\nthe sleeper changes the air. A man in travelling \\\\\\\"condition\\\\\\\" would\\\\r\\\\nprobably find a drugget-bag more healthy than macintosh, even though he\\\\r\\\\nbecame somewhat wet inside it. Beds used to be almost unknown in some\\\\r\\\\nparts of the Pyrenees. Sheepskin sleeping-bags were employed instead.\\\\r\\\\nThus, I am assured that at the beginning of this century, there was\\\\r\\\\nhardly a bed in the whole of the little republic of Andorre. The way of\\\\r\\\\narranging them as knapsacks is, as I have said, a recent invention.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn fig. 1 the wide opening to the mouth of the bag is shown; also the\\\\r\\\\nends of the buckles and straps that are sewn (on patches of leather, for\\\\r\\\\nadditional strength) to the lower side of the bag, as seen in fig. 2.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt must be understood that the woolly sides of the skins are inwards. The\\\\r\\\\nstraps that hold the knapsack to the shoulders are secured by a simple\\\\r\\\\nfastening, shown in figs. 2 and 3. But the ordinary knapsack hooks and\\\\r\\\\nrings, if procurable, would answer the purpose better. The straight lines\\\\r\\\\nin fig. 1 show the way in which the bag is to be folded into the shape of\\\\r\\\\nfig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the sleeper inside his bag, in which he fits very\\\\r\\\\nlike a grub in its cocoon. There is no waste of space. For the sake of\\\\r\\\\nwarmth, the bag is made double from the knees downwards, and also\\\\r\\\\nopposite to the small of the back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Figs 3 and 4].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the daytime, when the weather is wet or cold, the bags are of much\\\\r\\\\nuse, for the douaniers sit with them pulled up to their waist. When\\\\r\\\\ncarried in the manner of a knapsack the bag sits perfectly well against\\\\r\\\\nthe shoulders; but, owing to the yielding nature of its substance, it\\\\r\\\\nlies too close to the back, and is decidedly oppressive. A wicker frame\\\\r\\\\nmight well be interposed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArctic Sleeping-bags.--Arctic travellers use coarse drugget bags, covered\\\\r\\\\nwith brown holland to make them less pervious to the wind, and having a\\\\r\\\\nlong flap at the upper end to fold down over the face. I have already\\\\r\\\\nextracted passages from travellers' accounts relating to them, in\\\\r\\\\nspeaking of \\\\\\\"Encamping on Snow,\\\\\\\" p. 140, and another, when speaking of\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Snow-walls with Tenting for their Roofs,\\\\\\\" p. 143.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMacintosh Sack.--Mr. Falconer writes to me as follows:--\\\\\\\"I travelled in\\\\r\\\\n1841 from Austin in Texas to Mexico through New Mexico. I left Austin in\\\\r\\\\nJune, and reached Zacateras on Christmas Day. During nearly the whole\\\\r\\\\nperiod we travelled from Austin to New Mexico, I camped without any\\\\r\\\\ncovering at night for myself, except a large macintosh, made up as a\\\\r\\\\nsack, with a piece so laid as a continuation of one side, as to be used\\\\r\\\\nas a coverlet, sufficient in length to be brought from the back, over the\\\\r\\\\nhead, and down on the breast. Inside I placed my blankets. I slept under\\\\r\\\\nthis covering during many a heavy storm at night, and got out of my\\\\r\\\\nsoft-coated shell dry in the morning. My opinion is, that every traveller\\\\r\\\\nwho works his way with a horse should fix on his own saddle the said\\\\r\\\\nmacintosh sack, two blankets, a tin cup, and a frying-pan. It is amazing,\\\\r\\\\nwhen you get into real working order, how few things are sufficient.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPeasants' Sack.--The peasants in the northern parts of Germany use a\\\\r\\\\nstrong linen sack, made to draw at one end. This they stuff with straw,\\\\r\\\\nhay, dry leaves, etc.; and, putting their feet into it, pull its mouth up\\\\r\\\\nto their armpits. They use them when driving their wagons in winter, and\\\\r\\\\nwhen lodging at their wretched roadside inns. (See a letter in the Times,\\\\r\\\\nFebruary 125.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBag, combined with Tent.--I should think that a combination of a sleeping\\\\r\\\\nbag with a very small tent, just large enough to enclose the man's head\\\\r\\\\nand shoulders, so as to permit him to eat or write when lying in his bag\\\\r\\\\nwithout fear of the wet would be the smallest and lightest arrangement,\\\\r\\\\ncompatible with efficiency, in a stormy climate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTENTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Although tents are not worth the trouble of pitching,\\\\r\\\\non dry nights, in a healthy climate, they are invaluable protectors to a\\\\r\\\\nwell-equipped traveller against rain, dew, and malaria. But a man who is\\\\r\\\\nnot so equipped, who has no change of clothes, and no bedstead to sleep\\\\r\\\\non, will do better to sleep in the open air, in front of a good camp\\\\r\\\\nfire. Napoleon I., speaking of soldiers, says ('Maximes de\\\\r\\\\nGuerre'):--\\\\\\\"Tents are not healthy; it is better for the soldier to\\\\r\\\\nbivouac, because he sleeps with his feet to the fire, whose neighbourhood\\\\r\\\\nquickly dries the ground on which he lies; some planks or a little straw\\\\r\\\\nshelter him from the wind. Nevertheless a tent is necessary for superior\\\\r\\\\nofficers, who have need to write and to consult a map.\\\\\\\" To a party\\\\r\\\\nencamped for a few days, tents are of great use as storehouses for\\\\r\\\\nproperty, which otherwise becomes scattered about, at the risk of being\\\\r\\\\nlost or pilfered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaterials for Tenting.--Light canvas is usually employed, and is, to all\\\\r\\\\nintents and purposes, waterproof. Silk, of equal strength with the\\\\r\\\\ncanvas, is very far lighter: its only disadvantage is its expense.\\\\r\\\\nCalico, or cotton canvas, is very generally used for small tents. Leather\\\\r\\\\nand felt are warm, but exceedingly heavy; and would only be used in very\\\\r\\\\ninclement climates, or where canvas could not be met with. Light matting\\\\r\\\\nis not to be despised: it is warm and pretty durable, and makes excellent\\\\r\\\\nawning or covering to a frame-work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiagonal Bracing.--A worn-out tent may be strengthened by sewing bands of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas, which cross each other, and make a kind of net-work: old sails\\\\r\\\\nare strengthened in this way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTent Pegs should be of galvanized iron; they are well worth the weight of\\\\r\\\\ncarriage, for not only do wooden ones often fail on an emergency, but\\\\r\\\\ncooks habitually purloin them when firewood is scarce.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTents.--Large Tents.--The art of tent-making has greatly advanced since\\\\r\\\\nthe days of the old-fashioned bell-tent, which is so peculiarly\\\\r\\\\nobjectionable, as to make it a matter of surprise that it was ever\\\\r\\\\ninvented and used. It is difficult to pitch; it requires many tent-pegs;\\\\r\\\\nit has ropes radiating all round it, over which men and horses stumble;\\\\r\\\\nand it is incommodious and ugly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn choosing a tent, select one that will stand in some sort of shape with\\\\r\\\\nonly four pegs, or with six at the very utmost; it should admit of being\\\\r\\\\npegged close to the ground without any intervening 'fly;' it is no\\\\r\\\\nobjection that it should require more than one pole; and, when\\\\r\\\\nconsidering how much weight it will be possible to carry, it must be\\\\r\\\\nborne in mind that the tent will become far heavier than it is found to\\\\r\\\\nbe in the peculiarly dry atmosphere of a tent-maker's show-room. It is\\\\r\\\\nvery convenient that a tent should admit of being pitched in more than\\\\r\\\\none form: for instance, that one side should open and form an awning in\\\\r\\\\nhot weather; also, that it should be easy to attach flys or awning to the\\\\r\\\\ntent to increase its available size during the daytime. All tents should\\\\r\\\\nbe provided with strong covers, for pack-ropes are sure to fray whatever\\\\r\\\\nthey press against; and it is better that the cover should suffer than\\\\r\\\\nthe tent itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nComparative Size of Tents.--The annexed diagram will show the points on\\\\r\\\\nwhich the roominess of a tent mainly depends.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of tent and occupants].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA man wants space to sit at a table, and also to get at his luggage in\\\\r\\\\norder either to pack it or to unpack it; lastly, he wants a reasonable\\\\r\\\\namount of standing room. A fair-sized tent ought to include the figures\\\\r\\\\ndrawn in the diagram; and I have indicated, by lines and shaded spaces,\\\\r\\\\nthe section of various descriptions of tents that would be just\\\\r\\\\nsufficient to embrace them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne side of the ordinary conical tents (fig. 1), of a front view of fig.\\\\r\\\\n5, and of pyramidal tents (fig. 6), are represented by the line ABC.\\\\r\\\\nThose that have a \\\\\\\"fall\\\\\\\" (fig. 2), by the lines CDLF. Gipsy-tents, as\\\\r\\\\ndescribed p. 161, umbrella-tents (fig. 4), and Jourts, p. 157, by the\\\\r\\\\nlines GHBK. Marquees (fig. 3), and a side view of fig. 5, by GLBM.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1-4--sketches of tents].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNotwithstanding the great height and width of conical tents, compared to\\\\r\\\\nthe others, we see by the diagram that they afford scanty space at the\\\\r\\\\nlevel of the head of a seated person. There is a recent contrivance by\\\\r\\\\nMajor Rhodes, to be seen at Silver and Co.'s, that is a modification of\\\\r\\\\nthe gipsy-tent. Among ordinary, well-known tents, I believe none will\\\\r\\\\nsatisfy the varied wants of a traveller so well as Edington's three-poled\\\\r\\\\ntents (fig. 5). After these I should choose a small marquee (fig. 3); but\\\\r\\\\nit is less secure in wind, and the pitch of its roof is bad for rain, and\\\\r\\\\nthe numerous straggling tent-ropes are objectionable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 5-7--sketches of tents].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA pyramidal tent (fig. 6), of seven or nine feet in the side, is\\\\r\\\\nremarkable for its sturdiness: it will stand any weather, will hold two\\\\r\\\\npeople and a fair quantity of luggage besides; it weighs from 25 to 40\\\\r\\\\nlbs. It is not a good tent for hot weather, for it is far too stuffy,\\\\r\\\\nthough by taking an additional joint to the tent-pole, and using\\\\r\\\\ntent-ropes (as may also be done with any other kind of tent), it may be\\\\r\\\\nmade more airy by being raised up, and by having walls added to it (fig.\\\\r\\\\n7). In default of canvas, the walls may be constructed of other\\\\r\\\\nmaterials. (See \\\\\\\"Materials for Huts.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTent Pitched over an Excavation.--A hole may be dug deeply beneath the\\\\r\\\\ntent floor, partly for the purpose of a store-room, and partly for that\\\\r\\\\nof a living-room when the weather is very inclement. This was practised\\\\r\\\\nbefore Sebastopol in the manner shown in the fig. p. 158. The notched\\\\r\\\\npole acts as a ladder for ascending from below.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJourts.--The Kirghis-jourt is a capacious, solid, warm, and fireproof\\\\r\\\\nstructure, that admits of being pitched or taken to pieces in an hour,\\\\r\\\\nand withstands the cold and violent winds of the steppes of Central Asia,\\\\r\\\\nin a way that no tent or combination of tents could pretend to effect. A\\\\r\\\\njourt of from 20 to 25, or even 30 feet in diameter, forms two\\\\r\\\\ncamel-loads, or about half a ton in weight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 8].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne camel carries the felt, the other the wood-work. Fig. 9 shows the\\\\r\\\\njourt half-covered; and fig. 10 gives an enlarged view of a portion of\\\\r\\\\nthe side. There are four separate parts in its structure:--1. The\\\\r\\\\ndoor-way, a solid piece of ornamental carpentering, that takes to pieces\\\\r\\\\ninstantly. 2. The sides, which consist of lengths of wood-work, that shut\\\\r\\\\nup on the principle of the contrivance known sometimes as \\\\\\\"lazy-tongs,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nand sometimes as \\\\\\\"easy-back scissors:\\\\\\\" they tie together and make a\\\\r\\\\ncircle, beginning and ending with the doorway; a tape is wound round\\\\r\\\\nthem, as shown in fig. 9, about one-third from their tops. 3. The\\\\r\\\\nroof-ribs. The bottom of each of these is tied to the sides of the jourt\\\\r\\\\n(A, fig. 10), and its top fits into a socket in--4, the roof-ring, which\\\\r\\\\nis a hoop of wood strengthened by transverse bars. Over this framework\\\\r\\\\nbroad sheets of felt are thrown: their own weight makes them lie\\\\r\\\\nsteadily, for they are quite an inch in thickness; however, in very\\\\r\\\\nstormy weather, if I recollect aright, they are weighted with stones, or\\\\r\\\\nthey are stitched together. There is no metal in the structure: the laths\\\\r\\\\nof willow-wood that form the sides are united, where they cross, by\\\\r\\\\npieces of sinew knotted at either end; these act as pivots when the sides\\\\r\\\\nare shut up. I am indebted to the late Mr. Atkinson for my information on\\\\r\\\\nthese interesting structures. Further particulars about them, the native\\\\r\\\\nway of making the felt, by continually rolling sheepskins with the wool\\\\r\\\\nbetween them, and numerous pictures, in which jourts form a striking\\\\r\\\\nfeature, will be found in his beautifully illustrated work on Siberia.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 9 and 10 as referred to above and Fig. 1 for following section].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Tents.--For tents of the smallest size and least pretensions,\\\\r\\\\nnothing can be better than the one represented in fig. 1: the ends are\\\\r\\\\nslit down their middles, and are laced or buttoned together, so that, by\\\\r\\\\nunfastening these, the tent spreads out to a flat sheet of the form of\\\\r\\\\nfig. 2, well adapted for an awning, or else it can be simply unrolled and\\\\r\\\\nused with the bedding. It is necessary that a tent should be roomy enough\\\\r\\\\nto admit of a man undressing himself, when wet through, without treading\\\\r\\\\nupon his bed and drenching it with mud and water; and therefore a tent of\\\\r\\\\nthe above description is found to be unserviceable, if less than about 7\\\\r\\\\nfeet long, or ending in a triangle of less than 5 1/2 feet in the side.\\\\r\\\\nPeat, the saddler in Bond Street, once made them; they cost 2 l. 10s.,\\\\r\\\\nand weighed 9 lbs. when dry. They are liable to bag in the side when the\\\\r\\\\nwind is high: a cross-pole or two sticks, following the seams of the\\\\r\\\\ncanvas in the above sketch, would make them tauter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlpine Tent.--Mr. Whymper contrived a tent for his alpine explorations,\\\\r\\\\nwhich he found eminently successful. It has a waterproof floor,\\\\r\\\\ncontinuous with the sides: it is supported by poles, that slip into hems\\\\r\\\\nof the cloth--two poles at either end. These tents have been used on\\\\r\\\\nvarious occasions by Mr. Whymper's brother in Alaska, and by Mr.\\\\r\\\\nFreshfield in the Caucasus, and were highly approved of, but I do not\\\\r\\\\nknow whether these tents would be altogether suitable for more\\\\r\\\\ncomfortable travel. I myself had a tent made on this principle some years\\\\r\\\\nago, but disliked it, for I found the continuity of the floor with the\\\\r\\\\nsides to act unsatisfactorily; the tent retained the damp, and the weight\\\\r\\\\nof the body, acting on the floor of the tent, was apt to disturb its\\\\r\\\\nwalls. Mr. Whymper's tent is procurable at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter,\\\\r\\\\n295, Oxford Street, London.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoating Tent.--Further on, in the chapter on \\\\\\\"Boats,\\\\\\\" the way is shown by\\\\r\\\\nwhich sailors make a tent out of their lug-sail, throwing it over a\\\\r\\\\nframework of oars.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGipsy Tent.--A traveller who has only a blanket, a plaid, or broad piece\\\\r\\\\nof material of any kind, with which he wishes to improvise a tent, may\\\\r\\\\nmake a framework of long wands, planting their ends in the ground,\\\\r\\\\nbending their tops together, and lashing or wattling them securely; over\\\\r\\\\nthis the blanket is thrown (fig. 3). If the sticks are sufficiently long\\\\r\\\\nand pliant, their ends should be bent over the roof half-way down the\\\\r\\\\nopposite side, as in fig. 1. This adds considerably to the strength of\\\\r\\\\nthe arrangement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1-3 as described in text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe gipsies in England use the following excellent contrivance to save\\\\r\\\\nthe trouble of tying the sticks together. They carry a light bar of wood,\\\\r\\\\n2 1/2 feet long, bound with string here and there to keep it from\\\\r\\\\nsplitting; through this, six holes, each big enough to admit the tip of\\\\r\\\\nthe little finger, are bored or burnt; they also carry eight hazel rods\\\\r\\\\nwith them, each six feet long, and arrange their framework as in fig. 2.\\\\r\\\\nIt will be observed that the two rods which are planted behind give\\\\r\\\\nadditional roominess and stability to the affair. The rug and pillow show\\\\r\\\\nthe position in which the occupants sleep. Blankets, not sheeting, pinned\\\\r\\\\ntogether with wooden pegs, are thrown over the whole, as in fig. 3.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and 2 as described in the text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTente d'abri.--The French, \\\\\\\"tente d'abri\\\\\\\" has not, so far as I know, been\\\\r\\\\nadopted by travellers: it seems hardly suitable, except for soldiers.\\\\r\\\\nEach man carried a square of canvas (fig. 1), with buttons and\\\\r\\\\nbutton-holes all round it, by which it can be doubly attached to other\\\\r\\\\nsimilar squares of canvas, and thus, from several separate pieces, one\\\\r\\\\nlarge cloth can be made. The square carried by the French soldier\\\\r\\\\nmeasures 5 feet 4 1/2 inches in the side, reckoning along the buttons; of\\\\r\\\\nthese there are nine along each edge, including the corner ones. Each\\\\r\\\\nsoldier has also to carry a tent-staff, or else a proportion of the pegs\\\\r\\\\nand cord. When six men club together they proceed as follows:--Three\\\\r\\\\ntent-sticks are fixed into the ground, whose tops are notched; a light\\\\r\\\\ncord is then passed round their tops, and fastened into the ground with a\\\\r\\\\npeg at each eng (fig. 2). Two sheets, A and B, are buttoned together and\\\\r\\\\nthrown over the cord, and then two other sheets, C and D; and C is\\\\r\\\\nbuttoned to A, and D to B (fig. 3). Lastly another sheet is thrown over\\\\r\\\\neach of the slanting cords, the one buttoned to A and B, and the other to\\\\r\\\\nC and D; and thus a sort of dog-kennel is formed, in which six men--the\\\\r\\\\nbearers of the six pieces of canvas--sleep. The sides of the tent are of\\\\r\\\\ncourse pegged to the ground. There are many modifications in the way of\\\\r\\\\npitching these tents. Should the sticks be wanting, faggots or muskets\\\\r\\\\ncan be used in their place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTent of Mosquito-netting.--I have been informed of a sportsman in Ceylon,\\\\r\\\\nwho took with him into the woods a cot with mosquito-curtains, as a\\\\r\\\\nprotection not only against insects, but against malaria. He also had a\\\\r\\\\nblanket rolled at his feet: at 3 in the morning, when the chill arose in\\\\r\\\\nthe woods, he pulled his blanket over him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPitching a Tent.--It is quite an art, so to pitch a tent as to let in or\\\\r\\\\nexclude the air, to take advantage of sun and shade, etc. etc. Every\\\\r\\\\navailable cloth or sheet may be pressed into service, to make awnings and\\\\r\\\\nscreens, as we see among the gipsies. There is a great deal of character\\\\r\\\\nshown in each different person's encampment. A tent should never be\\\\r\\\\npitched in a slovenly way: it is so far more roomy, secure and pretty,\\\\r\\\\nwhen tightly stretched out, that no pains should be spared in drilling\\\\r\\\\nthe men to do it well. I like to use a piece of string, marked with\\\\r\\\\nknots, by which I can measure the exact places in which the tent-pegs\\\\r\\\\nshould be struck, for the eye is a deceitful guide in estimating\\\\r\\\\nsquareness. (See \\\\\\\"Squaring.\\\\\\\") It is wonderful how men will bungle with a\\\\r\\\\ntent, when they are not properly drilled to pitch it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo secure Tent-ropes.--When the soil is loose, scrape away the surface\\\\r\\\\nsand, before driving the tent-pegs. Loose mould is made more tenacious by\\\\r\\\\npouring water upon it. When one peg is insufficient, it may be backed by\\\\r\\\\nanother. (See fig.) The outermost peg must be altogether buried in the\\\\r\\\\nearth. Heavy saddle-bags are often of use to secure the tent-ropes; and,\\\\r\\\\nin rocky ground, heavy piles of stones may be made to answer the same\\\\r\\\\npurpose. The tent-ropes may also be knotted to a cloth, on which stones\\\\r\\\\nare afterwards piled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Dateram\\\\\\\" is, as the late Dr. Barth, informed me, the Bornu name for a\\\\r\\\\nmost excellent African contrivance, used in some parts of the Sahara\\\\r\\\\ndesert, by means of which tent-ropes may be secured, or horses picketed\\\\r\\\\nin sand of the driest description, as in that of a sand dune, whence a\\\\r\\\\ntent-peg would be drawn out by a strain so slight as to be almost\\\\r\\\\nimperceptible. I have made many experiments upon it, and find its\\\\r\\\\nefficiency to be truly wonderful. The plan is to tie to the end of the\\\\r\\\\ntent-rope, a small object of any description, by its middle, as a short\\\\r\\\\nstick, a stone, a bundle of twigs, or a bag of sand; and to bury it from\\\\r\\\\n1 to 2 feet in the loose sand. It will be found, if it has been buried 1\\\\r\\\\nfoot deep, that a strain equal to about 50 lbs. weight, is necessary to\\\\r\\\\ndraw it up; if 1 1/2 feet deep, that a much more considerable strain is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary; and that, if 2 feet deep, it is quite impossible for a single\\\\r\\\\nman to pull it up. In the following theoretical case, the resistance\\\\r\\\\nwould be as the cube of the depth; but in sand or shingle, the increase\\\\r\\\\nis less rapid. It varies under different circumstances; but it is no\\\\r\\\\nexaggeration to estimate its increase as seldom less than as the square\\\\r\\\\nof the depth. The theoretical case of which I spoke, is this:--Let x be\\\\r\\\\npart of a layer of shingle of wide extent: the shingle is supposed to\\\\r\\\\nconsist of smooth hard spherical balls, all of the same size. Let s be a\\\\r\\\\ndï¿½terï¿½m buried in x; and T the string to which it is tied. Now, on\\\\r\\\\nconsidering fig. 2, where a series of balls are drawn on a larger scale\\\\r\\\\nand on a plane surface, it is clear that the ball A cannot move in any\\\\r\\\\ndegree to the right or the left without disturbing the entire layer of\\\\r\\\\nballs on the same plane as itself: its only possible movement is\\\\r\\\\nvertically upwards. In this case, it disturbs B1 and B2. These, for the\\\\r\\\\nsame reason as A, can only move vertically upwards, and, in doing so,\\\\r\\\\nthey must disturb the three balls above them, and so on. Consequently,\\\\r\\\\nthe uplifting of a single ball in fig. 2, necessitates the uplifting of\\\\r\\\\nthe triangle of balls of which it forms the apex; and it obviously\\\\r\\\\nfollows from the same principle, that the uplifting of S, in the depth of\\\\r\\\\nX, in fig. 1, necessitates the uplifting of a cone of balls whose apex is\\\\r\\\\nat S. But the weight of a cone is as the cube of its height and,\\\\r\\\\ntherefore, the resistance to the uplifting of the dï¿½terï¿½m, is as the cube\\\\r\\\\nof the depth at which it has been buried. In practice, the grains of sand\\\\r\\\\nare capable of a small but variable amount of lateral displacement, which\\\\r\\\\ngives relief to the movement of sand caused by the dateram, for we may\\\\r\\\\nobserve the surface of the ground to work very irregularly, although\\\\r\\\\nextensively, when the dï¿½terï¿½m begins to stir. On the other hand, the\\\\r\\\\nfriction of the grains of sand tends to increase the difficulty of\\\\r\\\\nmovement. The arrangement shown in the diagram, of a spring\\\\r\\\\nweighing-machine tied to the end of a lever, is that which I have used in\\\\r\\\\ntesting the strain the dateram will resist, under different\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances. The size of the dateram is not of much importance, it\\\\r\\\\nwould be of still less importance in the theoretical case. Anything that\\\\r\\\\nis more than 4 inches long seems to answer. The plan succeeds in a dry\\\\r\\\\nsoil of any description, whether it be shingly beach or sand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBushing a Tent means the burying of bushes in the soil so far as to leave\\\\r\\\\nonly their cut ends above the ground, to which a corresponding number of\\\\r\\\\ntent-ropes are tied.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTent-poles.--When a tent is pitched for an encampment of some duration,\\\\r\\\\nit is well to lay aside the jointed tent-pole, and to cut a stout young\\\\r\\\\ntree to replace it: this will be found far more trustworthy in stormy\\\\r\\\\nweather. If the shape of the tent admits of the change, it is still\\\\r\\\\nbetter to do away with the centre pole altogether; and, in the place of\\\\r\\\\nit, to erect a substantial framework of poles, which are to be planted\\\\r\\\\njust within the rim of the tent, and to converge to a point, under its\\\\r\\\\npeak. A tent-pole can be lengthened temporarily, by lashing it to a log,\\\\r\\\\nwith the help of a Toggle and strop (which see). A broken tent-pole can\\\\r\\\\nbe mended permanently by placing a splint of wood on either side of the\\\\r\\\\nfracture, and by whipping the whole together, with soft cord or with the\\\\r\\\\nuntwisted strand of a piece of rope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo prevent Tent-poles from slipping.--When the tent is pitched in the\\\\r\\\\nordinary way on a smooth rocky surface, there is considerable danger that\\\\r\\\\nthe foot of the pole may slip whenever a gust of wind or other sudden\\\\r\\\\nimpulse sways the tent. This danger is to be obviated on precisely the\\\\r\\\\nsame principle as that by which builders secure their scaffolding-poles\\\\r\\\\nupon the smooth footways of a street: they put the foot of each pole into\\\\r\\\\na bucket, filled with sand. As the base of the bucket is broad, the\\\\r\\\\nscaffolding is much less liable to slip, than if the narrow bases of the\\\\r\\\\npoles had rested directly upon the pavement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo tie Things to Tent-poles.--To hang clothes, or anything else, upon a\\\\r\\\\nsmooth tent-pole, see \\\\\\\"Clove-hitch.\\\\\\\" A strap with hooks attached to it,\\\\r\\\\nbuckled round the pole, is very convenient. The method shown in the\\\\r\\\\nsketch suffices, if the pole be notched, or jointed, or in any way\\\\r\\\\nslightly uneven. Bags, etc., are supposed to be hung upon the bit of wood\\\\r\\\\nthat is secured to the free end. Convenient pegs, made of bits of wood\\\\r\\\\nroughly sharpened, may be driven into the tree, if any, when the\\\\r\\\\nencampment is made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPreparations for a Storm.--Before a storm, dig a ditch as deep as you can\\\\r\\\\nround the outside of the tent, to divert the coming sheet of\\\\r\\\\nsurface-water, and see that the ditch has a good out-fall. The ditch will\\\\r\\\\nalso drain the floor of the tent, if the rain should soak in. Even a\\\\r\\\\nfurrow scratched with a tent-peg, is better than no ditch at all. Fasten\\\\r\\\\nguy-ropes to the spike of the tent-pole; and be careful that the tent is\\\\r\\\\nnot too much on the strain, else the further shrinking of the materials,\\\\r\\\\nunder the influence of the wet, will certainly tear up the pegs. Earth,\\\\r\\\\nbanked up round the bottom of the tent, will prevent gusts of wind from\\\\r\\\\nfinding their way beneath. It is also a good plan to prepare a small hole\\\\r\\\\nnear the foot of the tent-pole, with a stone firmly rammed into the\\\\r\\\\nbottom, into which the tent-pole may be shifted, as soon as the strain of\\\\r\\\\nthe tent, under the influence of the wet, becomes dangerous to its\\\\r\\\\nsafety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo warm Tents.--\\\\\\\"When living in a tent in Otago (New Zealand) during a\\\\r\\\\nsevere winter, we were perfectly numb with cold at nights, until we\\\\r\\\\nadopted the Maori plan, which is to dig a hole about a foot square in the\\\\r\\\\nclear, to cover the bottom with a stone or stones, and to fill it at\\\\r\\\\nnight with red-hot cinders from the camp fire, and lastly, to close the\\\\r\\\\ntent excepting a small opening near the top. The cinders are not nearly\\\\r\\\\nburnt out by morning. They diffused a pleasant warmth through the tent,\\\\r\\\\nand rendered us comfortable all night. There is no danger of suffocation,\\\\r\\\\nunless the tent be closed up very tight indeed.\\\\\\\"--(W. M. Cooper.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPermanent Camp.--The accompanying sketch shows a tent pitched for a\\\\r\\\\nlengthened habitation. It has a deep drain, a seat and table dug out, and\\\\r\\\\na fireplace. (See the following paragraphs.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLost Articles.--Small articles are constantly mislaid and trampled in the\\\\r\\\\nsand of the floor of the tent. In searching for them, the ground should\\\\r\\\\nbe disturbed as little as possible: it is a usual plan to score its\\\\r\\\\nsurface in parallel lines, with a thin wand. It would be well worth while\\\\r\\\\nto make a small light rake to use for this purpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrecautions against Thieves.--Natives are apt to creep up to tents, and,\\\\r\\\\nputting their hands under the bottom of them, to steal whatever they can:\\\\r\\\\na hedge of thorn-bushes is a protection against this kind of thieving. In\\\\r\\\\nsome countries a net, with three or four bells attached to it, is thrown\\\\r\\\\nover the packages inside a tent. Strings tied horizontally, a foot above\\\\r\\\\nthe ground, from package to package, are found effective in tripping\\\\r\\\\nintruders, See also \\\\\\\"Guns set as Spring-guns.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFURNITURE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFurniture.--The luxuries and elegances practicable in tent-life, are only\\\\r\\\\nlimited by the means of transport. Julius Cï¿½sar, who was a great\\\\r\\\\ncampaigner, carried parquets of wooden mosaic for his floors! The\\\\r\\\\narticles that make the most show for their weight, are handsome rugs, and\\\\r\\\\nskins, and pillows; canteens of dinner and coffee services; and candles,\\\\r\\\\nwith screens of glass, or other arrangements to prevent them from\\\\r\\\\nflickering. The art of luxurious tenting is better understood in Persia\\\\r\\\\nthan in any other country, even than in India.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBedsteads.--A portable bedstead, with mosquito-curtains, is a very great\\\\r\\\\nluxury, raising the sleeper above the damp soil, and the attacks of most\\\\r\\\\ncreatures that creep on it; in tours where a few luxuries can be carried,\\\\r\\\\nit is a very proper article of baggage. It is essential where white ants\\\\r\\\\nare numerous. A very luxurious bed is made on the principle of a\\\\r\\\\ntennis-player's raquet; being a framework of wood, with strips of raw\\\\r\\\\nhide lashed across it from side to side and from end to end. It is the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"angareb\\\\\\\" of Upper Egypt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHammocks and Cots.--I stated in previous editions of this book, that\\\\r\\\\nhammocks and cots had few advocates, owing to the difficulty of\\\\r\\\\nsuspending them; but Captain M'Gwire's recent ingenious invention quite\\\\r\\\\nalters the case. His method will be easily understood by the annexed\\\\r\\\\nsketch. The apparatus is adapted for use on the wooden floors of houses,\\\\r\\\\nor ships, by the employment of eyelet-bolts or screw rings instead of\\\\r\\\\npegs, and by putting wooden shoes below the staves to prevent their\\\\r\\\\nslipping inwards: the shoes are tied to the eyelet-bolts by a cord.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe complete apparatus, in a very portable form, can be bought at Messrs.\\\\r\\\\nBrown's, Piccadilly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMosquito Nets and their Substitutes.--A mosquito-curtain may be taken for\\\\r\\\\nsuspension over the bed, or place where you sit; but it is dangerous to\\\\r\\\\nread in them by candle-light, for they catch fire very easily. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Incombustible Stuffs.\\\\\\\") It is very pleasant, in hot, mosquito-plagued\\\\r\\\\ncountries, to take the glass sash entirely out of the window-frame, and\\\\r\\\\nreplace it with one of gauze. Broad network, if of fluffy thread, keeps\\\\r\\\\nwasps out. The darker a house is kept, the less willing are flies, etc.,\\\\r\\\\nto flock in. If sheep and other cattle be hurdled-in near the house, the\\\\r\\\\nnuisance of flies, etc., becomes almost intolerable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChairs.--It is advisable to take very low strong and roomy camp-stools,\\\\r\\\\nwith tables to correspond in height, as a chamber is much less choked up\\\\r\\\\nwhen the seats are low, or when people sit, as in the East, on the\\\\r\\\\nground. The seats should not be more than 1 foot high, though as wide and\\\\r\\\\ndeep as an ordinary footstool. Habit very soon reconciles travellers to\\\\r\\\\nthis; but without a seat at all, a man can never write, draw, nor\\\\r\\\\ncalculate as well as if he had one. The stool represented in the figure\\\\r\\\\n(above), is a good pattern: it has a full-sized seat made of canvas or\\\\r\\\\nleather, or of strips of dressed hide. A milk-man's stool, supported by\\\\r\\\\nonly one peg, is quickly made in the bush, and is not very inconvenient.\\\\r\\\\nThe common rush-bottomed chair can be easily made, if proper materials\\\\r\\\\nare accessible. The annexed diagram explains clearly the method of their\\\\r\\\\nconstruction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTable.--The table may consist of a couple of boards, not less than 2 feet\\\\r\\\\nlong, by 9 inches broad, hinged lengthwise, for the convenience of\\\\r\\\\ncarriage, and resting on a stand, which should be made on the same\\\\r\\\\nprinciple as the framework of the chair described above. It is well to\\\\r\\\\nhave the table made of mahogany, for deal warps and cracks excessively.\\\\r\\\\nThere is no difficulty in carrying furniture like the above, on a\\\\r\\\\npack-horse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMakeshift Chair and Table.--For want of a chair, it is convenient to dig\\\\r\\\\na hole or a trench in the ground, and to sit on one side of it, with the\\\\r\\\\nfeet resting on its bottom: the opposite side of the trench serves as a\\\\r\\\\ntable, on which things may be put, within easy reach.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"In a box 2 feet long and 1 foot square at the ends, the lid and its\\\\r\\\\nbottom, of course, both measure 2 feet by 1 foot. Now, if the bottom\\\\r\\\\nopens on hinges, just like the lid, and if the hinges of both lid and\\\\r\\\\nbottom are fixed to the hindmost side of the box, then when the box is\\\\r\\\\nlaid face downwards, and both the lid and the bottom are opened out and\\\\r\\\\nsecured in the same horizontal plane with the side to which they are\\\\r\\\\nhinged, a table of 3 feet by 2 feet is made. The lid and bottom form the\\\\r\\\\ntwo leaves of the table, and what was the hindmost side, when the box\\\\r\\\\nstood on its bottom, is now uppermost, and forms the middle of the table.\\\\r\\\\nSuch a box would hold, during travel, the things wanted when encamping.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n--(Peal.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHooks.--I have spoken of the way of hanging articles in tents, under\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Tent Poles.\\\\\\\" In a permanent bivouac or in a hut, it is convenient to fix\\\\r\\\\nhooked sticks or the horns of animals, against the walls, as pegs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFIRE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Although, in the teeth of every precaution, fires\\\\r\\\\nconstantly break out, yet when a traveller wants a light and does not\\\\r\\\\nhappen to have any of his ingenious fire-making contrivances at hand, it\\\\r\\\\nis very difficult for him to obtain it. And further, though sparks, of\\\\r\\\\ntheir own accord and in the most unlikely places, too often give rise to\\\\r\\\\nconflagrations, yet it requires much skill and practice to succeed\\\\r\\\\nwithout fail, in coaxing a small spark into a serviceable camp fire.\\\\r\\\\nTherefore every traveller should carry on his person the means of\\\\r\\\\nprocuring a light, under ordinary circumstances of wind and weather; that\\\\r\\\\nis to say, he should have in his pocket a light handy steel, a flint or\\\\r\\\\nan agate, and amadou or other tinder. I also strongly recommend that he\\\\r\\\\nshould carry a bundle of half-a-dozen fine splinters of wood, like\\\\r\\\\nminiature tooth-picks, thinner and shorter than lucifer-matches, whose\\\\r\\\\npoints he has had dipped in melted sulphur; also a small spare lump of\\\\r\\\\nsulphur of the size of a pea or bean, in reserve. The cook should have a\\\\r\\\\nregular tinder-box, such as he happens to have been used to, and an\\\\r\\\\nabundance of wax lucifers. Paper fusees are not worth taking in travel,\\\\r\\\\nas wet entirely spoils them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere are usually three separate agents in making a fire, each of which\\\\r\\\\nmay be varied in many ways and requires separate description. 1. The\\\\r\\\\nSpark or other light to start with. 2. The Tinder; that is, some easily\\\\r\\\\nignited and smouldering substance. 3. Fuel, judiciously applied to the\\\\r\\\\nburning tinder, or other feeble light, so as to develop it into a\\\\r\\\\nserviceable fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo obtain Fire from the Sun.--Burning-glasses.--The object-glass, and\\\\r\\\\nevery other convex glass of a telescope is a burning-glass, and has only\\\\r\\\\nto be unscrewed to be fit for use. The object lenses of an opera-glass\\\\r\\\\nare very efficient. The larger the glass and the shorter its focus, the\\\\r\\\\ngreater is its heating power. Convex spectacle glasses and eye glasses\\\\r\\\\nare too small and of too long a focus to be used with effect, except when\\\\r\\\\nthe sun is very hot. An old-fashioned watch-glass, filled with water, and\\\\r\\\\nhaving the rays of a powerful sun glittered down upon it vertically by\\\\r\\\\nhelp of a mirror, will give a light. Dr. Kane and other arctic travellers\\\\r\\\\nhave made burning-glasses of ice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReflectors.--The inside of the polished metal cover of a hunting-watch\\\\r\\\\nwill sometimes converge a sufficiency of rays, to burn. The vestal fire\\\\r\\\\nof Rome and the sacred fire of the Mexicans were obtained by means of\\\\r\\\\nreflectors. If I understand aright, they consisted of a stone with a\\\\r\\\\nconical hollow, carefully polished, the apex of the hollow cone was a\\\\r\\\\nright angle: the tinder was held in the axis of the cone. See Tylor's\\\\r\\\\n'Early History of Mankind.'\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlack Tinder.--Tinder that is black by previous charring, or from any\\\\r\\\\nother cause, ignites in the sun far sooner than light-coloured tinder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFire by conversion of motion into heat.--General Remarks.--When a moving\\\\r\\\\nbody is arrested, heat is given out; the quantity of heat being in exact\\\\r\\\\nproportion to the mass, multiplied into the square of its velocity. Thus\\\\r\\\\nif a cannon ball be fired at an iron target, both it and the ball become\\\\r\\\\nexceedingly hot. There is even a flash of light when the velocity of the\\\\r\\\\nball is very high. When bullets are fired with heavy charges at a target,\\\\r\\\\nthe lead is just melted by the heat of impact, and it \\\\\\\"splashes,\\\\\\\" to use\\\\r\\\\na common phrase. It is obvious from these two examples, that no velocity\\\\r\\\\nwhich the hand of man is able to give to a steel, when striking a flint,\\\\r\\\\nor to one stick rubbing against another stick, will be competent to\\\\r\\\\nafford a red-hot temperature unless the surface against which impact or\\\\r\\\\nfriction is made be very small, or unless great care be taken to avoid\\\\r\\\\nthe wasteful dissipation of heat. The spark made by a flint and steel,\\\\r\\\\nconsists of a thin shaving of steel, scraped off by the flint and heated\\\\r\\\\nby the arrested motion. When well struck, the spark is white-hot and at\\\\r\\\\nthat temperature it burns with bright scintillations in the air, just as\\\\r\\\\niron that is merely red-hot burns in pure oxygen. This is the theory: now\\\\r\\\\nfor the practice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlints.--If we may rely on a well-known passage in Virgil, concerning\\\\r\\\\nï¿½neas and his comrades, fire was sometimes made in ancient days by\\\\r\\\\nstriking together two flints, but I confess myself wholly unable to light\\\\r\\\\ntinder with flints alone, and I am equally at a loss to understand what\\\\r\\\\nwere the \\\\\\\"dry leaves\\\\\\\" that they are said in the same passage to have used\\\\r\\\\nfor tinder. Neither can I obtain fire except with a flint and steel, or,\\\\r\\\\nat least, hardened iron; a flint and ordinary iron will not give an\\\\r\\\\navailable spark. Flints may be replaced by any siliceous stone, as agate,\\\\r\\\\nrock-crystal, or quartz. Agate is preferred to flint, for it gives a\\\\r\\\\nhotter spark: it is sold by tobacconists. A partly siliceous stone, such\\\\r\\\\nas granite, will answer in default of one that is wholly siliceous. I\\\\r\\\\nhave been surprised at finding that crockery and porcelain of all kinds\\\\r\\\\nwill make a spark, and sometimes a very good one. There are cases where a\\\\r\\\\nbroken teacup might be the salvation of many lives in a shipwrecked\\\\r\\\\nparty. On coral-reefs, and other coasts destitute of flinty stones,\\\\r\\\\nsearch should be made for drift-wood and drifted sea-weed. In the roots\\\\r\\\\nof these, the pebbles of other shores are not unfrequently entangled, and\\\\r\\\\nflint may be found among them. The joints of bamboos occasionally contain\\\\r\\\\nenough silex to give a spark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSteels.--The possession of a really good steel is a matter of great\\\\r\\\\ncomfort in rough travel, for, as I have just said, common iron is\\\\r\\\\nincompetent to afford a useful spark, and hardened iron or soft steel is\\\\r\\\\nbarely sufficient to do so. Any blacksmith will make a good steel out of\\\\r\\\\nan old file, if he has nothing more appropriate at hand. A substitute for\\\\r\\\\na steel can be made, even by an ordinary traveller, out of common iron,\\\\r\\\\nby means of \\\\\\\"casehardening\\\\\\\" (which see). The link of a chain, or the heel\\\\r\\\\nof a boot, or a broken horse-shoe, is of a convenient shape for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPyrites are, and have been, widely used for striking sparks. Two pieces\\\\r\\\\nstruck together, or one piece struck with a steel, gives a good spark;\\\\r\\\\nbut it is a very friable mineral, and therefore not nearly so convenient\\\\r\\\\nas flint.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGuns.--If you wish to get a light by means of a flint-and-steel gun, the\\\\r\\\\ntouch-hole may be stuffed up, and a piece of tinder put among the priming\\\\r\\\\npowder: a light can be obtained in that way without firing the gun. With\\\\r\\\\na percussion-cap gun, a light may be obtained by putting powder and\\\\r\\\\ntinder outside the nipple and round the cap; it will, though not with\\\\r\\\\ncertainty catch fire on exploding the cap. But the common way with a gun\\\\r\\\\nis to pour in a quarter of a charge of powder, and above it, quite\\\\r\\\\nloosely, a quantity of rag or tinder. On firing the gun straight up in\\\\r\\\\nthe air, the rag will be shot out lighted; you must then run after it as\\\\r\\\\nit falls, and pick it quickly up. With percussion-caps, gunpowder, and\\\\r\\\\ntinder, and without a gun, a light may sometimes be had on an emergency,\\\\r\\\\nby scratching and boring with a knife, awl, or nail, at the fulminating\\\\r\\\\ncomposition in the cap, till it explodes; but a cap is a somewhat\\\\r\\\\ndangerous thing to meddle with, as it often flies with violence, and\\\\r\\\\nwounds. Crushing gunpowder with hard stones may possibly make it explode.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLucifers.--An inexperienced hand will waste an entire boxful of them, and\\\\r\\\\nyet will fail in lighting a fire in the open air, on a windy day. The\\\\r\\\\nconvenience of lucifers in obtaining a light is very great, but they have\\\\r\\\\ntwo disadvantages: they require that the air should be perfectly still,\\\\r\\\\nwhile the burning sulphur is struggling to ignite the stick; and, again,\\\\r\\\\nwhen the match is thrust among the wood, the sticks upon which is has to\\\\r\\\\nact, have not been previously warmed and consequently, though one or two\\\\r\\\\nof them may become lighted, the further progress of the fire is liable to\\\\r\\\\ncease. On the other hand, in methods where the traveller begins with\\\\r\\\\ntinder, and blows its spark into a flame, the adjacent wood becomes\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly heated by the process, and the flame, once started, is almost\\\\r\\\\ncertain to maintain itself. Consequently, in lighting a fire with\\\\r\\\\nlucifers, be careful to shield the match from the wind, by throwing a\\\\r\\\\ncloak or saddle-cloth, or something else over the head, whilst you\\\\r\\\\noperate; and secondly, to have abundance of twigs of the smaller sizes,\\\\r\\\\nthat there may be no uncertainty of the lucifer-match being able to light\\\\r\\\\nthem, and set the fire a-going. In a steady downfall of rain, you may\\\\r\\\\nlight a match for a pipe under your horse's belly. If you have paper to\\\\r\\\\nspare, it is a good plan to twist it into a hollow cone; to turn the cone\\\\r\\\\nwith its apex to the wind; and immediately after rubbing the match, to\\\\r\\\\nhold it inside the cone. The paper will become quickly heated by the\\\\r\\\\nstruggling flame and will burst into a miniature conflagration, too\\\\r\\\\nstrong to be puffed out by a single blast of air. Wax lucifers are\\\\r\\\\nundoubtedly better than wooden ones, for in damp weather, wooden ones\\\\r\\\\nwill hardly burn; but wax is waterproof, and independent of wet or dry.\\\\r\\\\nWhen there is nothing dry, at hand, to rub the lucifer-match against,\\\\r\\\\nscratch the composition on its head with the edge of a knife or with the\\\\r\\\\nfinger-nail. It is a sure way of lighting it; and with care, there is no\\\\r\\\\nneed of burning the fingers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFire-sticks.--In every country without exception, where inquiry has been\\\\r\\\\nmade, the method of obtaining fire by rubbing one stick against another,\\\\r\\\\nhas been employed. In savage countries the method still remains in\\\\r\\\\npresent use; in nearly all the more civilised ones, it has been\\\\r\\\\nsuperseded within historic periods by flints and steels and the like, and\\\\r\\\\nwithin this present generation by lucifer-matches. The only instance I\\\\r\\\\nknow in which flints are said to have preceded fire-sticks, is in the\\\\r\\\\nquotation below from Pliny. A light has also been obtained in\\\\r\\\\npre-historic times, as I have already mentioned, by reflecting the sun\\\\r\\\\nfrom a hollow surface; but this method required costly apparatus, and\\\\r\\\\ncould never have been in common use. Hence, although so far as I am\\\\r\\\\naware, the Bible, and Homer, and other records of great antiquity, are\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely silent on the contemporary methods of procuring fire; and\\\\r\\\\nalthough Pliny says the reverse--I think we are justified in believing\\\\r\\\\nthat the plan of rubbing sticks together was absolutely universal in the\\\\r\\\\nbarbaric infancy of the human race. In later Greek History, Prometheus is\\\\r\\\\naccredited with the invention of fire-sticks. Among the Romans both\\\\r\\\\nSeneca and Pliny write about them. Pliny says (Nat. Hist. xvi. 76, 77),\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"There is heat in the mulberry, in the bay-laurel, in ivy, and in all\\\\r\\\\nplants whence fire-sticks are made. The experience of soldiers\\\\r\\\\nreconnoitring for encamping-grounds, and that of shepherds, made this\\\\r\\\\ndiscovery; for a stone is not always at hand whence a spark might be\\\\r\\\\nstruck. One piece of wood therefore, is rubbed by another, and it catches\\\\r\\\\nfire through the friction, while a dry tindery substance--fungus and\\\\r\\\\nleaves are the most easilyattainable--is used to perpetuate the fire.\\\\r\\\\nNothing is better than ivy used as the stick to be rubbed, and bay-laurel\\\\r\\\\nas the stick to rub with. Wild vine--not the 'labrusca'--is also found\\\\r\\\\ngood.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI have made a great many experiments with different kinds of wood, having\\\\r\\\\nprocured an assortment of those used by the fancy toy-makers of Tunbridge\\\\r\\\\nWells, and the chippings from botanical gardens. I find what I have heard\\\\r\\\\nfrom savages to be quite true; viz., that it is much more difficult to\\\\r\\\\nprocure good wood for the \\\\\\\"fire-block\\\\\\\" than for the drill-stick; any\\\\r\\\\nthough hard, and dry stick will do for the latter, but the fire-block\\\\r\\\\nmust be of wood with little grain; of a middle degree of softness;\\\\r\\\\nreadily inflammable; and, I presume, a good on-conductor of heat; but I\\\\r\\\\ndo not know if there be much difference, in this latter respect, between\\\\r\\\\nwoods of the same quality. If it be too hard, the action of the\\\\r\\\\ndrill-stick will merely dent and polish it; if very soft, it will be worn\\\\r\\\\naway before the friction has time to heat it sufficiently: ivy is\\\\r\\\\nexcellent. I find it not at all difficult to produce smoke (it is much\\\\r\\\\nmore difficult to produce fire) with a broken fishing-rod, or ramrod, as\\\\r\\\\na drill-stick, and a common wooden pill-box, or tooth-powder box, as a\\\\r\\\\nfire-block. Walnut, also, does as a fire-block, and the stock of a gun is\\\\r\\\\nof walnut. Deal and mahogany are both worthless for fire-sticks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is well so to notch the fire-block, that the wood-dust, as it is\\\\r\\\\nformed by the rubbing, should all run into one place: it will then glow\\\\r\\\\nwith a smouldering heat, ready to burst out into an available flame with\\\\r\\\\na very little fanning, as soon as a degree of heat sufficient to ignite\\\\r\\\\ntinder has been attained. Tinder is a great convenience, in ensuring that\\\\r\\\\nthe fire, once obtained, shall not be lost again; but it is not essential\\\\r\\\\nto have it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere are many ways of rubbing the sticks together, in use among\\\\r\\\\ndifferent nations. Those curious in the matter should consult Tylor's\\\\r\\\\n'Early History of Mankind.' But the traveller will not obtain much\\\\r\\\\nassistance from these descriptions, as it will be out of his power to\\\\r\\\\nobtain fire by any but the simplest of them, on a first trial. He is only\\\\r\\\\nlikely to succeed at first by working at leisure, with perfectly dry\\\\r\\\\nwood. Even savages, who practise the art all their lives, fail to procure\\\\r\\\\nfire in very wet weather, when the shelter is bad. Of the plans employed\\\\r\\\\nby savages, the simplest is that in use both in South Africa and in\\\\r\\\\nAustralia.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Australian blacks use the flower-stem of the grass-tree, which is of\\\\r\\\\na tough pithy nature, and about one inch in diameter. The operation of\\\\r\\\\nmaking the fire is assisted by the use of a little charcoal-powder,\\\\r\\\\nwhich, in Australia, is found on the bark of almost every tree, from the\\\\r\\\\nconstant passage of grass-fires over the ground. The process is as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--One piece of the stick is notched in the middle, fig. 1, and\\\\r\\\\nthe notch slightly hollowed out; another is roundly pointed at one end.\\\\r\\\\nThe black fellow, being seated on the ground, holds down one end of the\\\\r\\\\nnotched stick with each foot, fig. 2, and placing the point of the other\\\\r\\\\nstick into the notch, twirls it rapidly and forcibly between the palms of\\\\r\\\\nhis hands. In doing this his hands gradually slip down the stick, and he\\\\r\\\\nhas to shift them rapidly up again, which loses time: but two people,\\\\r\\\\nseated opposite, can alternately take up the rubbing, and more easily\\\\r\\\\nproduce fire. A little of the above-mentioned powdered charcoal is\\\\r\\\\ndropped into the notch during the operation. In a very few minutes\\\\r\\\\nred-hot powdery ashes commence to work up out of the notch, which falling\\\\r\\\\non a small heap of tow, or of dry tow-like bark, or lint, or cotton\\\\r\\\\nstuff, is quickly blown into a flame. The Africans carry the drill-stick,\\\\r\\\\nwhich in shape and size is like an arrow, in a quiver with their arrows,\\\\r\\\\nand the fire-block--a stick three inches long and one in diameter, of a\\\\r\\\\ndifferent wood--as a pendant to their necklace.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA plan more practicable to an unpractised hand is that in use among some\\\\r\\\\nof the North American Indians. I copy the illustration of it from\\\\r\\\\nSchoolcraft's work upon those people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne person works the \\\\\\\"drill-stick\\\\\\\" with a rude bow, and with his other\\\\r\\\\nhand holds a piece of stone or of wood above it, both to steady it and to\\\\r\\\\ngive the requisite pressure--gentle at first, and increasing judiciously\\\\r\\\\nup to the critical moment when the fire is on the point of bursting out.\\\\r\\\\nAnother man puts his hands on the lower piece of wood, the \\\\\\\"fire-block,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nto steady it, and holds a piece of tinder ready to light it as soon as\\\\r\\\\nfire is produced. If a serious emergency should occur, it is by no means\\\\r\\\\nhopeless to obtain fire after this method. A large party have\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable advantages over only one or two men, because as the work is\\\\r\\\\nfatiguing, the men can undertake it in turns; and, again, as considerable\\\\r\\\\nknack is required for success, it is much more probable that one man out\\\\r\\\\nof many should succeed, than that only one man, taken at hazard, should\\\\r\\\\ndo so. But the best plan of all for a party of three or more men is for\\\\r\\\\none of them to hold the upper block, another to hold the lower block and\\\\r\\\\nthe tinder, should there be any, and the third man to cause the\\\\r\\\\ndrill-stick to rotate. He will effect this best by dispensing with the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"bow,\\\\\\\" and by simply using a string or thong of a yard or four feet long.\\\\r\\\\nHe makes one or two turns with the string round the drill-stick, and then\\\\r\\\\nholding one end of the string in either hand, he saws away with all his\\\\r\\\\nforce. I believe that a party of three men, furnished with dry wood of an\\\\r\\\\nappropriate quality and plenty of string, would surely produce smoke on\\\\r\\\\nthe first few trials, but that they would fail in producing fire. If,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, they had a couple of hours' leisure to master the knack of\\\\r\\\\nworking these sticks, I think they would succeed in producing fire before\\\\r\\\\nthe end of that time. The period of time necessary for a successful\\\\r\\\\noperation is from one to three minutes. It is of little use fatiguing\\\\r\\\\nyourself with sustaining the exertion for a longer period at a time,\\\\r\\\\nunless the wood becomes continuously hotter. As soon as the temperature\\\\r\\\\nremains uniform it shows that you have let the opportunity slip; it is\\\\r\\\\nthen the best economy of effort to desist at once, to rest, to take\\\\r\\\\nbreath, and recommence with fresh vigour.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch unlabelled].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFire by Chemical Means.--It is not in the province of this book to\\\\r\\\\ndescribe the various matches that take fire by dipping them into\\\\r\\\\ncompositions; and I have already spoken of lucifer-matches in the last\\\\r\\\\nsection. Only one source of fire remains to be noticed, it is--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpontaneous Combustion.--It is conceivable that the property which masses\\\\r\\\\nof greasy rags, and such-like matter, possess of igniting when left to\\\\r\\\\nthemselves, might under some circumstances, be the only means available\\\\r\\\\nto procure fire. It is at all events well that this property should be\\\\r\\\\nborne in mind when warehousing stores, in order to avoid the risk of\\\\r\\\\ntheir taking fire. Any oil mixed with a hatful of shavings, tow, cotton,\\\\r\\\\nwool, or rags, heaped together, will become very hot in one, two, or more\\\\r\\\\ndays, and will ultimately burst into flame. The rapidity of the process\\\\r\\\\nis increased by warmth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTinder.--General Remarks.--There are two divisions of tinder: those that\\\\r\\\\nare of a sufficiently strong texture to admit of being grasped in the\\\\r\\\\nhand, and those that are so friable as to require a box to hold them. In\\\\r\\\\nthe first division (a) are the following:--amadon, a roll of rag, a\\\\r\\\\ncotton lamp-wick, a roll of touch-paper, a mass of hair of certain\\\\r\\\\nplants, and a long string of pith sewed up in a sheath. To ignite these,\\\\r\\\\nwe must hold them as in fig. 1, and use the steel to strike downwards\\\\r\\\\nupon the flint. In the second division (b) are:--tinder of burnt rags,\\\\r\\\\ntinder of any kind with grains of gunpowder strewed over it, and\\\\r\\\\ntouch-wood. All these require tinder-boxes, as explained below. There are\\\\r\\\\nalso many other substances belonging to both divisions of tinder, in use.\\\\r\\\\nA traveller should inform himself about those peculiar to the country\\\\r\\\\nthat he visits.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\na Amacou, punk, or German tinder, is made from a kind of fungus or\\\\r\\\\nmushroom that grows on the trunks of old oaks, ashes, beeches, etc.; many\\\\r\\\\nother kinds of fungus, and, I believe, all kinds of puff-balls, will also\\\\r\\\\nmake tinder. \\\\\\\"It should be gathered in August or September, and is\\\\r\\\\nprepared by removing the outer bark with a knife, and separating\\\\r\\\\ncarefully the spongy yellowish mass that lies within it. This is cut into\\\\r\\\\nthin slices, and beaten with a mallet to soften it, till it can easily be\\\\r\\\\npulled asunder between the fingers. It is then boiled in a strong\\\\r\\\\nsolution of saltpetre.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA Roll of Rag.--Cotton rag will easily take fire from the spark from a\\\\r\\\\nflint, in a very dry climate, if well struck. It must be rolled up\\\\r\\\\nmoderately tight, so as to have the end of the roll fluffy; the rag\\\\r\\\\nhaving been torn, not cut. A rag rolled in this way is not bad tinder, if\\\\r\\\\nthe sparks are strong, and one commences to blow it the instant one of\\\\r\\\\nthe fibres is seen to be alight. If its fluffy end be rubbed into a\\\\r\\\\nlittle dry gunpowder, its property as tinder is greatly improved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCotton Lamp-wick.--A piece of it drawn through a tin tube, to shield the\\\\r\\\\npreviously charred part from being rubbed off, is excellent in dry\\\\r\\\\nclimates. (See fig. 1, p. 180.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTouch-paper is merely paper dipped in a solution of saltpetre, or what\\\\r\\\\ncomes to nearly the same thing and is somewhat better, paper smeared with\\\\r\\\\ndamp gunpowder until it is blackened. Some grains of uncrushed gunpowder\\\\r\\\\nshould be left adhering to the paper, and a few more should be allowed to\\\\r\\\\nlie loosely upon it. Unsized paper, like that out of a blotting-book, is\\\\r\\\\nthe best suited for making into touch-paper; paper is rendered unsized by\\\\r\\\\nbeing well soaked and washed in water. (See next paragraph.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSaltpetre for Tinder.--In all cases the presence of saltpetre makes\\\\r\\\\ntinder burn more hotly and more fiercely; and saltpetre exists in such\\\\r\\\\ngreat quantities in the ashes of many plants (as tobacco, dill, maize,\\\\r\\\\nsunflower), that these can be used, just as they are, in the place of it.\\\\r\\\\nThus, if the ashes of a cigar be well rubbed into a bit of paper, they\\\\r\\\\nconvert it into touch-paper. So will gunpowder, for out of four parts of\\\\r\\\\nit, three are saltpetre; damaged gunpowder may be used for making\\\\r\\\\ntouch-paper. If it be an object to prepare a store of tinder, a strong\\\\r\\\\nsolution of saltpetre in water should be obtained, and the paper, or\\\\r\\\\nrags, or fungus, dipped into it and hung to dry. This solution may be\\\\r\\\\nmade by pouring a little water on a charge of gunpowder, or on the ashes\\\\r\\\\nabove-mentioned, which will dissolve the saltpetre out of them. Boiling\\\\r\\\\nwater makes a solution forty-fold stronger than ice-cold water, and about\\\\r\\\\neight times stronger than water at 60 degrees Fahr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHair of Plants.--The silky down of a particular willow (S. lanata) was\\\\r\\\\nused by the Esquimaux, with whom Dr. Kane had intercourse; and the\\\\r\\\\nbotanist Dr. Lindley once informed me that he had happened to receive a\\\\r\\\\npiece of peculiarly excellent tinder that was simply the hair of a\\\\r\\\\ntree-fern. The Gomuti tinder of the Eastern Archipelago is the hair of a\\\\r\\\\npalm.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPith.--Many kinds of pith are remarkable as tinders; that whence the\\\\r\\\\nwell-known pith hats are made, is used as tinder in India. Pieces of pith\\\\r\\\\nare often sewn round with thin cotton or silk, so as to form a long cord,\\\\r\\\\nlike the cotton lamp-wick I have described above, and they are carried in\\\\r\\\\ntubes for the same reason.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nb. We now come to the different kinds of tinder that fall into our second\\\\r\\\\ndivision, namely, those that are too friable to bear handling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRags.--Charred linen rags make the tinder that catches fire most easily,\\\\r\\\\nthat burns most hotly when blown upon, and smoulders most slowly when\\\\r\\\\nleft to itself, of any kind of tinder that is generally to be obtained.\\\\r\\\\nIn making it the rags are lighted, and when in a blaze and before they\\\\r\\\\nare burnt to white ashes, the flame is stifled out. It is usual to make\\\\r\\\\nthis kind of tinder in the box intended to hold it; but it can easily be\\\\r\\\\nmade on the ground in the open air, by setting light to the rag, and\\\\r\\\\ndropping pinches of sand upon the flaming parts as soon as it is desired\\\\r\\\\nto quench them. The sand is afterwards brushed away, and the tinder\\\\r\\\\ngently extricated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTouch-wood is an inferior sort of tinder, but is always to be met with in\\\\r\\\\nwoody countries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDry Dung.--Dry and powdered cattle dung--especially horse-dung--will\\\\r\\\\ntake a spark, but with trouble. After it is lighted it can be kept\\\\r\\\\nburning with little difficulty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTinder-boxes.--There are three ways of striking a flint, which are best\\\\r\\\\nexplained by sketches. Fig. 1, p. 180, shows how tinder that is tough\\\\r\\\\nenough to bear handling, is grasped together with the flint. When no\\\\r\\\\ntinder-box is at hand the more friable kinds of tinder, as touch-wood,\\\\r\\\\nmay be enveloped in a roll of rag and be used either as in fig. 1 or in\\\\r\\\\nfig 3. Fig. 2 shows how tinder may be laid on the ground, and how sparks\\\\r\\\\nmay be struck upon it. The household tinder-boxes of thirty years ago,\\\\r\\\\nbefore lucifers were invented, were for use in this way. Fig. 3 shows how\\\\r\\\\nsparks may be struck into a small tinder-box. It is the method most\\\\r\\\\ncommonly adopted by travellers: for instance, it is universally used in\\\\r\\\\nSouth Africa and in North America. A hollow cylinder of wood or metal,\\\\r\\\\nabout three inches long, and corked up at one end, is all that is\\\\r\\\\nessential. If it be barrel-shaped the flint lies against its sides, at\\\\r\\\\nthe most convenient angle for striking sparks into the box, as is shown\\\\r\\\\nby the bottom drawing of fig. 3.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 2 and 3 as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWet Weather.--In long-continued soaking weather, the best way of keeping\\\\r\\\\na tinder-box dry is to put it into a small pocket hung close under the\\\\r\\\\narmpit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFuel.--Firewood.--There is a knack in finding firewood. It should be\\\\r\\\\nlooked for under bushes; the stump of a tree that is rotted nearly to the\\\\r\\\\nground has often a magnificent root, fit to blaze throughout the night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDry Cattle-dung.--The dry dung of cattle and other animals, as found on\\\\r\\\\nthe ground, is very generally used throughout the world, in default of\\\\r\\\\nbetter fuel, and there is nothing whatever objectionable in employing it.\\\\r\\\\nThe Canadians call it by the apt name of \\\\\\\"Bois de Vache.\\\\\\\" In North and\\\\r\\\\nSouth Africa it is frequently used; throughout a large part of Armenia\\\\r\\\\nand of Thibet the natives rely entirely upon it. There is a great\\\\r\\\\nconvenience in this sort of fuel; because, as it is only in camps that\\\\r\\\\nfuel is wanted, so it is precisely at old encamping-places that\\\\r\\\\ncattle-dung is abundantly found.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBones.--Another remarkable substitute for firewood is bones; a fact which\\\\r\\\\nMr. Darwin was, I believe, the first to mention. The bones of an animal,\\\\r\\\\nwhen freshly killed, make good fuel; and even those of cooked meat, and\\\\r\\\\nsuch as have been exposed to the air for some days, will greatly increase\\\\r\\\\nthe heat of a scanty fire. Their smell is not disagreeable: it is simply\\\\r\\\\nthat of roast or burnt meat. In the Falkland Islands, where firewood is\\\\r\\\\nscarce, it is not unusual to cook part of the meat of a slaughtered bull\\\\r\\\\nwith its own bones. When the fire is once started with a few sticks, it\\\\r\\\\nburns well and hotly. The flame of course depends on the fat within the\\\\r\\\\nbones, and therefore the fatter the animal the better the fire. During\\\\r\\\\nthe Russian campaign in 1829, the troops suffered so severely from cold\\\\r\\\\nat Adrianople, that the cemeteries were ransacked for bones for fuel.\\\\r\\\\n(Moltke, in the Appendix.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSea-weed makes a hot though not a cheerful fire. It is largely used. The\\\\r\\\\nvraic or sea-weed gatherers of the Channel Islands are represented in\\\\r\\\\nmany picturesque sketches. The weed is carted home, spread out, and\\\\r\\\\ndried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPeat.--Travellers must bear in mind that peat will burn, especially as\\\\r\\\\nthe countries in which it is found are commonly destitute of firewood;\\\\r\\\\nand, besides that, are marshy, cold, and aguish.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCharcoal is frequently carried by travellers in sacks; they use a\\\\r\\\\nprepared charcoal in the East, which is made in the form of very large\\\\r\\\\nbuttons, that are carried strung together on a string. An Indian\\\\r\\\\ncorrespondent informs me that they are made by mixing powdered charcoal\\\\r\\\\nwith molasses, in the proportion of ten to one, or thereabouts, rolling\\\\r\\\\nthe mass into balls, and drying them in the sun. A single ball is called\\\\r\\\\na \\\\\\\"gul.\\\\\\\" They are used for igniting hookhas: they are also burnt inside\\\\r\\\\nthe smoothing-iron used by washermen in order to heat it. The juice or\\\\r\\\\nsap of many plants would probably answer the purpose of molasses in their\\\\r\\\\npreparation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Fuel for lighting the Fire.--Shreds and Fibres.--The live spark has\\\\r\\\\nto be received and partly enclosed, in a loose heap or nest of\\\\r\\\\nfinely-shredded fuel. The substances for making such a nest, are one or\\\\r\\\\nother of the following list:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDry grass of the finest kinds: leaves: moss: lichen, and wild cotton;\\\\r\\\\nstalks or bark, broken up and rubbed small between the fingers; peat or\\\\r\\\\ncattle-dung pulverised; paper that has been doubled up in many folds and\\\\r\\\\nthen cut with a sharp knife into the finest possible shavings; tow, or\\\\r\\\\nwhat is the same thing, oakum, made by unravelling rope or string; and\\\\r\\\\nscrapings and fine shavings from a log of wood. The shreds that are\\\\r\\\\nintended to touch the live spark should be reduced to the finest fibre;\\\\r\\\\nthe outside of the nest may be of coarser, but still of somewhat delicate\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCook should collect them.--It is the duty of a cook, when the time of\\\\r\\\\nencamping draws near, to get down from his horse, and to pick up, as he\\\\r\\\\nwalks along, a sufficiency of dry grass, little bits of wood, and the\\\\r\\\\nlike, to start a fire; which he should begin to make as soon as ever the\\\\r\\\\ncaravan stops. The fire ought to be burning, and the kettle standing by\\\\r\\\\nits side, by the time that the animals are caught and are ready to be\\\\r\\\\noff-packed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Sticks.--There should be abundance of small sticks, and if neither\\\\r\\\\nthese nor any equivalent for them are to be picked up, the traveller\\\\r\\\\nshould split up his larger firewood with his knife, in order to make\\\\r\\\\nthem. It is a wise economy of time and patience to prepare plenty of\\\\r\\\\nthese; otherwise it will occasionally happen that the whole stock will be\\\\r\\\\nconsumed and no fire made. Then the traveller must recommence the work\\\\r\\\\nfrom the very beginning, under the disadvantage of increasing darkness. I\\\\r\\\\nhave made many experiments myself, and have seen many novices as well as\\\\r\\\\nold campaigners try to make fires; and have concluded that, to ensure\\\\r\\\\nsuccess, the traveller should be provided with small bundles of sticks of\\\\r\\\\neach of the following sizes:--1st, size of lucifer-match; 2nd, of lead\\\\r\\\\npencil; 3rd, smaller than little finger; 4th, size of fore-finger; 5th,\\\\r\\\\nstout stakes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn wet Weather, the most likely places to find wherewithal to light a\\\\r\\\\nfire, are under large stones and other shelter; but in soaking wet\\\\r\\\\nweather, little chips of dry wood can hardly be procured except by\\\\r\\\\ncutting them with an axe out of the middle of a log. The fire may then be\\\\r\\\\nbegun, as the late Admiral the Hon. C. Murray well recommended in his\\\\r\\\\ntravels in North America, in the frying-pan itself, for want of a dry\\\\r\\\\npiece of ground.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo kindle a Spark into a Flame.--By whirling.--1st. Arrange the fuel\\\\r\\\\ninto logs; into small fuel, assorted as described above, and into shreds\\\\r\\\\nand fibres. 2nd. Make a loose nest of the fibre, just like a sparrow's\\\\r\\\\nnest in shape and size, and let the finer part of the fibres be inwards.\\\\r\\\\n3rd. Drop the lighted tinder in the next. 4th. Holding the \\\\\\\"nest\\\\\\\" quite\\\\r\\\\nloosely in the half-closed hand, whirl the outstretched arm in vertical\\\\r\\\\ncircles round the shoulder-joint, as indicated by the dotted line in the\\\\r\\\\ndiagram. In 30 seconds, or about 40 revolutions, it will begin to glow,\\\\r\\\\nand will shortly after burst out in a grand flame. 5th Drop it, and pile\\\\r\\\\nsmall twigs round it, and nurse the young fire carefully, bearing in mind\\\\r\\\\nthe proverb that \\\\\\\"small sticks kindle a flame, but large ones put it\\\\r\\\\nout.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy blowing.--Savages usually kindle the flame by blowing at the live\\\\r\\\\nspark and feeding it with little bits of stick, just so much as is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary. But it is difficult to acquire the art of doing this well, and\\\\r\\\\nI decidedly recommend the plan I have described in the foregoing\\\\r\\\\nparagraph, in preference to it. When the wind blowssteadily and freshly,\\\\r\\\\nit suffices to hold up the \\\\\\\"nest\\\\\\\" against the wind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSulphur matches are so very useful to convert a spark into a flame, and\\\\r\\\\nthey are so easily made, in any quantity, out of split wood, straw, etc.,\\\\r\\\\nif the traveller will only take the trouble of carrying a small lump of\\\\r\\\\nsulphur in his baggage, that they always ought to be at hand. The sulphur\\\\r\\\\nis melted on a heated stone, or in an old spoon, bit of crockery, bit of\\\\r\\\\ntin with a dent made in it, or even a piece of paper, and the points of\\\\r\\\\nthe pieces of wood dipped in the molten mass. A small chip of sulphur\\\\r\\\\npushed into the cleft end of a splinter of wood makes a fair substitute\\\\r\\\\nfor a match. (See \\\\\\\"Lucifer-matches.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCamp Fires.--Large Logs.--The principle of making large logs to burn\\\\r\\\\nbrightly, is to allow air to reach them on all sides, and yet to place\\\\r\\\\nthem so closely together, that each supports the combustion of the rest.\\\\r\\\\nA common plan is to make the fire with three logs, whose ends cross each\\\\r\\\\nother, as in the diagram. The dots represent the extent of the fire. As\\\\r\\\\nthe ends burn away, the logs are pushed closer together. Another plan is\\\\r\\\\nto lay the logs parallel with the burning ends to the windward, then they\\\\r\\\\ncontinue burning together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the pine-forests of the North, at winter time, it is usual to fell a\\\\r\\\\nlarge tree, and, cutting a piece six or eight feet long off the large\\\\r\\\\nend, to lay the thick short piece upon the long one, which is left lying\\\\r\\\\non the ground; having previously cut flat with the axe the sides that\\\\r\\\\ncome in contact, and notched them so as to make the upper log lie steady.\\\\r\\\\nThe chips are then heaped in between the logs, and are set fire to; the\\\\r\\\\nflame runs in between them, and the heat of each log helps the other to\\\\r\\\\nburn. It is the work of nearly an hour to prepare such a fire; but when\\\\r\\\\nmade, it lasts throughout the night. In all cases, one or two great logs\\\\r\\\\nare far better than many small ones, as these burn fast away and require\\\\r\\\\nconstant looking after. Many serious accidents occur from a large log\\\\r\\\\nburning away and toppling over with a crash, sending a volley of blazing\\\\r\\\\ncinders among the sleeping party. Savages are always getting burnt, and\\\\r\\\\nwe should take warning from their carelessness: sometimes they find a\\\\r\\\\nsingle scathed tree without branches, which they have no means of\\\\r\\\\nfelling; this they set fire to as it stands, and when all have fallen off\\\\r\\\\nto sleep, the tree tumbles down upon them. Indeed, savages are seldom\\\\r\\\\nfree from scars or severe burns; they are so cold during the night that\\\\r\\\\nthey cannot endure to be an inch further from the fire than necessary,\\\\r\\\\nand consequently, as they turn about in their sleep, often roll into it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Diagram as described following].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLogs to cut up, with a small axe or knife.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLet A O be the log. Cut two notches (1), (2), on opposite sides. Hold the\\\\r\\\\nlog by the end A, and strike the end violently against the ground; the\\\\r\\\\npiece O, 1, 2, will fly off. Then make the cut (3) on the side opposite\\\\r\\\\nto (2), and again strike, and the piece 1, 2, 3, will fly off. So again\\\\r\\\\nwith cut (4), etc. (Peal.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBrushwood.--If in a country where any a number of small sticks and no\\\\r\\\\nlarge logs can be collected as firewood, the best plan is to encamp after\\\\r\\\\nthe manner of the Ovampos. These, as they travel, collect sticks, each\\\\r\\\\nman his own faggot, and when they stop, each takes eight or nine stones\\\\r\\\\nas large as bricks, or larger, and sets them in a circle; and within\\\\r\\\\nthese he lights up his little fire. Now the party make their fireplaces\\\\r\\\\nclose together, in two or more parallel lines, and sleep in between them;\\\\r\\\\nthe stones prevent the embers from flying about and doing mischief, and\\\\r\\\\nalso, after the fires have quite burnt out, they continue to radiate\\\\r\\\\nheat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCharcoal.--If charcoal be carried, a small chafing-dish, or other\\\\r\\\\nsubstitute for a fireplace, ought also be taken, together with a set of\\\\r\\\\ntin cooking-utensils.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFireplaces in Boats.--In boating excursions, daub a lump of clay on the\\\\r\\\\nbottom of the boat, beneath the fireplace--it will secure the timbers\\\\r\\\\nfrom fire. \\\\\\\"Our primitive kitchen was a square wooden box, lined with\\\\r\\\\nclay and filled with sand, upon which three or four large stones were\\\\r\\\\nplaced to form a hearth.\\\\\\\" (Burton's 'Medinah.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFireplaces on Snow.--On very deep snow, a hearth has to be made of a\\\\r\\\\nnumber of green logs, upon which the fire may be made. (See \\\\\\\"Esquimaux\\\\r\\\\nCooking Lamp.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCooking-fires.--See chapter on \\\\\\\"Cooking.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFires in the early Morning.--Should your stock of fuel consist of large\\\\r\\\\nlogs and but little brushwood, keep all you can spare of the latter to\\\\r\\\\nmake a blaze, when you get up to catch and pack the cattle in the dark\\\\r\\\\nand early morning. As you travel on, if it be bitter cold, carry a\\\\r\\\\nfirebrand in your hand, near your mouth, as a respirator--it is very\\\\r\\\\ncomforting; then, when the fire of it burns dull, thrust the brand for a\\\\r\\\\nfew moments in any tuft of dry grass you may happen to pass by, which\\\\r\\\\nwill blaze up and give a new life to the brand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFOOD.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe nutritive Elements of Food.--Many chemists have applied themselves in\\\\r\\\\nrecent years, to discover the exact percentage of nutriment contained in\\\\r\\\\ndifferent substances, and to determine the minimum nutriment on which\\\\r\\\\nhuman life can be supported. The results are not very accordant, but\\\\r\\\\nnevertheless a considerable approximation to truth has been arrived at.\\\\r\\\\nIt is now possible to tell whether a proposed diet has any great faults\\\\r\\\\nof excess or deficiency, and how to remedy those faults. But it also must\\\\r\\\\nbe recollected that the stomach is an assimilating machine of limited\\\\r\\\\nperformance, and must be fed with food that it can digest; it is not\\\\r\\\\nenough that the food should contain nutritious matter, if that matter\\\\r\\\\nshould be in an indigestible form. Burke and Wills perished from sheer\\\\r\\\\ninability to digest the seeds upon which the Australian savages lived;\\\\r\\\\nand Gardiner's party died of starvation in Tierra del Fuego, because they\\\\r\\\\ncould not digest the shell-fish which form a common article of diet of\\\\r\\\\nthe natives of that country. The question of diet must then be limited to\\\\r\\\\nfood that is perfectly digestible by the traveller. It remains to learn\\\\r\\\\nhow much nourishment is contained in different kinds of digestible food.\\\\r\\\\nDr. Smith has recently written an elaborate essay on this subject,\\\\r\\\\napplying his inquiries chiefly to the food of the poor in England; but\\\\r\\\\nfor my more general purpose, as it is impossible to do justice to a large\\\\r\\\\nand imperfectly understood subject, in the small space I can give to it,\\\\r\\\\nit will be better that I should reprint the results given in my previous\\\\r\\\\nedition. These are principally extracted from a remarkable paper by Dr.\\\\r\\\\nChristison, inserted in the Bluebook Report of the Commission of Inquiry\\\\r\\\\non Crimean matters, in which the then faulty dietary of our soldiers was\\\\r\\\\ndiscussed. It appears 1st, that a man of sedentary life can exist in\\\\r\\\\nhealth on seventeen ounces per day of real nutriment; that a man engaged\\\\r\\\\nin active life requires fully twenty-eight ounces per day; and, during\\\\r\\\\nsevere labour, he requires thirty ounces, or even more. 2ndly, that this\\\\r\\\\nnutriment must consist of three-quarters, by weight, of one class of\\\\r\\\\nnutritive principles, (C), and one quarter of another class of nutritive\\\\r\\\\nprinciples, (N); 3rdly, that all the articles of common food admit of\\\\r\\\\nbeing placed, as below, in a Table, by which we see at a glance how much\\\\r\\\\nnutriment of class C, and how much of class N, is found in 100 parts,\\\\r\\\\ngross weight of any of them. Thus, by a simple computation, the effective\\\\r\\\\nvalue of a dietary may be ascertained. Class C, are the carboniferous\\\\r\\\\nprinciples, that maintain respiration; Class N, are the nitrogenous\\\\r\\\\nprinciples, that repair waste of tissue. N will partly replace C, but at\\\\r\\\\na great waste: C will not replace N.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA large number of diets such as those of various armies and navies, of\\\\r\\\\nprisons and infirmaries, and of the ordinary diets of different classes\\\\r\\\\nof people, have been examined by aid of this Table, with surprisingly\\\\r\\\\nuniform results. But these diets chiefly refer to temperate climates; it\\\\r\\\\nwould therefore be a matter of great interest if travellers in distant\\\\r\\\\nlands would accurately observe and note down the weight of their own\\\\r\\\\nrations and those of the natives. It is a great desideratum to know the\\\\r\\\\nlightest portable food suitable to different countries. Any such reports,\\\\r\\\\nif carefully made and extending over a period of not less than two\\\\r\\\\nmonths, would be very acceptable to me. To make them of any use, it is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary that every article consumed should be noted down; and that the\\\\r\\\\nweight and state of health, at the beginning and at the end of the\\\\r\\\\nperiod, should be compared.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n__________________________________________________\\\\r\\\\nTable showing the quantity of Nutriment contained\\\\r\\\\nin different articles of Diet.\\\\r\\\\n__________________________________________________________________\\\\r\\\\nArticles of Diet    ..

At the same time, I must say that Australian\\\\r\\\\nexplorers seem to travel exceedingly well on unusually scanty diets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFood Suitable for the Stores of Travellers.--The most portable kind of\\\\r\\\\nfood is, unquestionably, the flesh of cattle; for the beasts carry\\\\r\\\\nthemselves. The draught oxen used in African and Australian explorations\\\\r\\\\nserve as a last resource, when all other food is wanting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt has been truly remarked with reference to Australian exploring\\\\r\\\\nexpeditions, that if an exploring party would make up their minds to eat\\\\r\\\\nhorseflesh, stores of provisions might be largely dispensed with. A few\\\\r\\\\nextra horses could be taken; and one shot occasionally, and its flesh\\\\r\\\\ndried and slightly salted, sufficiently to preserve it from becoming\\\\r\\\\ntainted before the men could consume it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPortable Food.--The kinds of food that are the most portable in the\\\\r\\\\nordinary sense of the term are:--Pemmican; meat-biscuit; fried meat;\\\\r\\\\ndried fish; wheat flour; biscuit; oatmeal; barley; peas; cheese; sugar;\\\\r\\\\npreserved potatoes; and Chollet's compressed vegetables. Extract of meat,\\\\r\\\\nas I am assured by the highest physiological authors, is not a portable\\\\r\\\\nfood but a portable savour. It is quite impossible that life should be\\\\r\\\\nmaintained on any minute amount of material, because so many grains of\\\\r\\\\ncarbon and so many of nitrogen are daily consumed, and an equivalent\\\\r\\\\nweight of those elements must, of course, be replaced. Salt meat is not\\\\r\\\\nto be depended upon, for it is liable to become hard and worthless, by\\\\r\\\\nlong keeping.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPemmican; general remarks.--Of all food usually carried on expeditions,\\\\r\\\\nnone is so complete in itself, nor contains so large a proportion of\\\\r\\\\nnutriment as pemmican. It is especially useful to those who undergo\\\\r\\\\nsevere work, in cold and rainy climates. It is the mainstay of Arctic\\\\r\\\\nexpeditions, whether on water, by sledge, or on foot. But, though\\\\r\\\\nexcellent to men who are working laboriously, it is distasteful to\\\\r\\\\nothers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPemmican is a mixture of about five-ninths of pounded dry meat to\\\\r\\\\nfour-ninths of melted or boiled grease; it is put into a skin bag or tin\\\\r\\\\ncan whilst warm and soft. The grease ought not to be very warm, when\\\\r\\\\npoured on the dry meat. Wild berries are sometimes added. The skin bags\\\\r\\\\nfor the pemmican should be shaped like pillow (not bolster) cases, for\\\\r\\\\nthe convenience of packing on horseback. The pemmican is chopped out with\\\\r\\\\nan axe, when required.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI do not know if it can be bought anywhere in England. It was usually\\\\r\\\\nprepared in the government yards at Deptford, when made for the Arctic\\\\r\\\\nExpeditions. It is largely used in the Hudson's Bay territory. A\\\\r\\\\ntraveller who desired to furnish himself with pemmican might procure his\\\\r\\\\nsupplies from thence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPemmican, as made in England.--Sir John Richardson describes, in his\\\\r\\\\nNarrative, the preparation of the pemmican that he took with him in his\\\\r\\\\nlast journey. The following is a rï¿½sum?of what he says:--The meat used\\\\r\\\\nwas round of beef; the fat and membranous parts were pared away; it was\\\\r\\\\nthen cut into thin slices, which were dried in a malt-kiln, over an\\\\r\\\\noak-wood fire, till they were quite dry and friable. Then they were\\\\r\\\\nground in a malt mill; after this process the powder resembled\\\\r\\\\nfinely-grated meal. It was next mixed with nearly an equal weight of\\\\r\\\\nmelted beef, suet, or lard; and the plain pemmican was made. Part of the\\\\r\\\\npemmican was mixed with Zante currants, and another part with sugar. Both\\\\r\\\\nof these mixtures were much liked, especially the latter. The pemmican,\\\\r\\\\nwhen complete, cost at the rate of 1x. u 1/2 d. per pound, but then the\\\\r\\\\nmeat was only 6 3/4 d. per pound; it is dearer now. The meat lost more\\\\r\\\\nthan three-quarters of its weight in drying. He had 17,424 lbs. of\\\\r\\\\npemmican in all; it was made from--fresh beef, 35,641 lbs; lard9\\\\r\\\\nlbs.; currants3 lbs.; and sugar lbs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPemmican, as made in the Prairie.--Mr. Ballantyne, who was in the service\\\\r\\\\nof the Hudson's Bay Company, gives the following account:--\\\\\\\"Having shot a\\\\r\\\\nbuffalo, the hunters cut lumps of his flesh, and slitting it up into\\\\r\\\\nflakes or layers, hang it up in the sun, or before a slow fire, to dry;\\\\r\\\\nand the fat can be dried as well as the lean. In this state, it is often\\\\r\\\\nmade into packs, and sent about the country, to be consumed as dried meat\\\\r\\\\n(it is often best relished raw, for, when grilled without fat, it burns\\\\r\\\\nand becomes ashy); but when pemmican is wanted, it has to go through\\\\r\\\\nanother process. When dry, the meat is pounded between two stones till it\\\\r\\\\nis broken into small pieces: these are put into a bag made of the\\\\r\\\\nanimal's hide, with the hair on the outside, and well mixed with melted\\\\r\\\\ngrease; the top of the bag is then sewn up, and the pemmican allowed to\\\\r\\\\ncool. In this state it may be eaten uncooked; but the men who subsist on\\\\r\\\\nit when travelling, mix it with a little flour and water, and then boil\\\\r\\\\nit--in which state it is know throughout the country by the elegant name\\\\r\\\\nof robbiboo. Pemmican is good wholesome food; will keep fresh for a great\\\\r\\\\nlength of time; and, were it not for its unprepossessing appearance, and\\\\r\\\\na good many buffalo hairs mixed with it, through the carelessness of the\\\\r\\\\nhunters, would be very palatable. After a time, however, one becomes\\\\r\\\\naccustomed to these little peculiarities.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMeat-biscuit.--Meat-biscuit, which is used in American ships, is stated\\\\r\\\\nto be a thick soup, evaporated down to a syrup, kneaded with flour, and\\\\r\\\\nmade into biscuits: these are pricked with holes, dried and baked. They\\\\r\\\\ncan be eaten just as they are, or made into a porridge, with from twenty\\\\r\\\\nto thirty times their weight of water. They were to be bought at\\\\r\\\\nGamble's, Leadenhall Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDried Meat.--When more game is shot than can be eaten before the party\\\\r\\\\ntravel onwards, it is usual to jerk a part of it. It is cut in long\\\\r\\\\nstrips, and festooned about the bushes, under the full sun, in order to\\\\r\\\\ndry it. After it has been sun-dried it will keep for long, before it\\\\r\\\\nbecomes wholly putrid. Dried meat is a poor substitute for fresh meat; it\\\\r\\\\nrequires long steeping in water, to make it tender, and then it is\\\\r\\\\ntasteless, and comparatively innutritious. \\\\\\\"Four expert men slice up a\\\\r\\\\nfull-grown buffalo in four hours and a-half.\\\\\\\" (Leichhardt.) The American\\\\r\\\\nbuccaneers acquired their name from boucan--which means jerked meat, in\\\\r\\\\nan Indian dialect; for they provisioned their ships with the dried flesh\\\\r\\\\nof the wild cattle that they hunted down and killed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDried Fish.--Fish may be pounded entire, just as they come from the\\\\r\\\\nriver, dried in the sun in large lumps, and kept: the negroes about the\\\\r\\\\nNiger do this.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlour travels conveniently in strong canvas bags, each holding 50 lbs.,\\\\r\\\\nand long enough to be lashed on to a pack-saddle. (See \\\\\\\"Pack-gabs,\\\\\\\" p.\\\\r\\\\n71.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChollet's preserved Vegetables relieve agreeably the monotony of a bush\\\\r\\\\ndiet. A single ration weighs less than an ounce, and a cubic yard\\\\r\\\\ncontains 16,000 of these rations. They are now to be bought at all\\\\r\\\\nprovision merchants'--as at Fortnum and Mason's, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalted Meat.--I have already said (see \\\\\\\"Portable Food\\\\\\\") that salt meat\\\\r\\\\ncannot be depended upon to retain its nutritious qualities for a length\\\\r\\\\nof time. When freshly made, it is sure to be good. It is well to\\\\r\\\\nrecollect that, for want of a salting-tub, animals can be salted in their\\\\r\\\\nown hide. A hollow is scraped in the ground, the hide is laid over it and\\\\r\\\\npegged down, and the meat, salt, and water put into it. I know of an\\\\r\\\\ninstance where this was one on a very large scale.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCondiments.--The most portable and useful condiments for a traveller\\\\r\\\\nare--salt, red pepper, Harvey's sauce, lime-juice, dried onions, and\\\\r\\\\ncurry-powder. They should be bought at a first-rate shop; for red pepper,\\\\r\\\\nlime-juice, and curry-powder are often atrociously adulterated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalt..--The craving for salt (chloride of sodium) is somewhat satisfied\\\\r\\\\nby the potash salts, and, perhaps, by other minerals: thus we often hear\\\\r\\\\nof people reduced to the mixing of gun-powder with their food, on account\\\\r\\\\nof the saltpetre that it contains. An impure salt is made widely in North\\\\r\\\\nAfrica, from wood-ashes. They are put into a pot, hot water is poured\\\\r\\\\nover them and allowed to stand and dissolve out the salts they contain;\\\\r\\\\nthe ley is then decanted into another pot, where it is evaporated. The\\\\r\\\\nplants in use, are those of which the wetted ashes have a saline and not\\\\r\\\\nan alkaline taste, nor a soapy feel. As a general rule, trees that make\\\\r\\\\ngood soap (p. 122), yield little saltpetre or other good equivalent for\\\\r\\\\nsalt. Salt caravans are the chief sustainers of the lines of commerce in\\\\r\\\\nNorth Africa. In countries where salt is never used, as I myself have\\\\r\\\\nwitnessed in South Africa, and among the Mandan North-American Indian\\\\r\\\\ntribes (Catlin, vol. i, p. 124), the soil and springs are \\\\\\\"brack.\\\\\\\" Four\\\\r\\\\nRussian sailors who were wrecked on Spitzbergen, and whose well-known\\\\r\\\\nadventures are to be found in Pinkerton's 'Voyages and Travels,' had\\\\r\\\\nnothing whatever for six years to subsist on--save only the animals they\\\\r\\\\nkilled, a little moss, and melted snow-water. One of them died; the\\\\r\\\\nothers enjoyed robust health. People who eat nothing but meat, feel the\\\\r\\\\ncraving for salt far less strongly than those who live wholly on\\\\r\\\\nvegetables.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nButcher.--One man in every party should have learnt from a professed\\\\r\\\\nbutcher, how to cut up a carcase to the best advantage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStore-keeping.--All stores should be packed and securely lashed, that it\\\\r\\\\nmay be impossible to pilfer from them. The packages of those that are in\\\\r\\\\nuse, should be carried in one pair of saddle-gabs, to be devoted to that\\\\r\\\\npurpose. These should stand at the storekeeper's bivouac, and nobody else\\\\r\\\\nshould be allowed to touch them, when there. He should  have every\\\\r\\\\nfacility for weighing and measuring. Lastly, it should be his duty to\\\\r\\\\nfurnish a weekly account, specifying what stores remain in hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWholesome Food, procurable in the Bush.--Game and Fish.--See sections\\\\r\\\\nupon \\\\\\\"Hints on Shooting;\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Other means of capturing Game;\\\\\\\" and upon\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Fishing;\\\\\\\" and note the paragraph on \\\\\\\"Nocturnal Animals.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMilk, to keep.--Put it in a bottle, and place it in a pot of water, over\\\\r\\\\na slow fire, till the water boils; let the bottle remain half an hour in\\\\r\\\\nthe boiling water, and then cork it tightly. Milk with one's tea is a\\\\r\\\\ngreat luxury; it is worth taking some pains to keep it fresh. A traveller\\\\r\\\\nis generally glutted with milk when near native encampments, and at other\\\\r\\\\ntimes has none at all. Milk dried into cakes, intended to be grated into\\\\r\\\\nboiling water for use, was formerly procurable: it was very good; but I\\\\r\\\\ncannot hear of it now in the shops. Milk preserved in tins is excellent,\\\\r\\\\nbut it is too bulky for the convenience of most travellers. Dried\\\\r\\\\nbread-crumb, mixed with fresh cream, issaid to make a cake that will keep\\\\r\\\\nfor some days. I have not succeeded, to my satisfaction with this recipe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nButter, to preserve.--Boil it in a large vessel till the scum rises. Skim\\\\r\\\\nthis off as fast as it appears on the surface, until the butter remains\\\\r\\\\nquite clear, like oil. It should then be carefully poured off, that the\\\\r\\\\nimpurities which settle at the bottom of the vessel may be separated. The\\\\r\\\\nclarified butter is to be put aside to be kept, the settlings must be\\\\r\\\\nused for common and immediate purposes. Butter is churned, in many\\\\r\\\\ncountries, by twirling a forked stick, held between the two hands, in a\\\\r\\\\nvessel full of cream; or even by shaking the cream in a bottle. It is\\\\r\\\\nsaid that the temperature of the milk, while it is being churned, should\\\\r\\\\nbe between 50 degrees and 60 degrees Fahr., and that this is\\\\r\\\\nall-important to success.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCheese.--\\\\\\\"The separation of the whey from the cheese may be effected by\\\\r\\\\nrennet, or by bitartrate of potash, or tamarinds, or alum, or various\\\\r\\\\nacids and acid wines and fruit juices.\\\\\\\" (Dr. Weber.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEggs may be dried at a gentle heat; then pounded and preserved. This is a\\\\r\\\\nconvenient plan of making a store of portable food out of the eggs of\\\\r\\\\nsea-birds, or those of ostriches.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFish-roe is another kind of portable food. The chemists declare its\\\\r\\\\ncomposition to be nearly identical with that of ordinary eggs. (Pereira.)\\\\r\\\\nCaviare is made out of any kind of fish-roe; but the recherch?sort, only\\\\r\\\\nfrom that of the sturgeon. Long narrow bags of strong linen, and a strong\\\\r\\\\nbrine, are prepared. The bags are half-filled with the roe, and are then\\\\r\\\\nquite filled with the brine, which is allowed to ooze through slowly.\\\\r\\\\nThis being done, the men wring the bags strongly with their hands, and\\\\r\\\\nthe roe is allowed to dry. Roe-broth is a good dish.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHoney, to find, when Bees are seen.--Dredge as many bees as you can, with\\\\r\\\\nflour from a pepper-box; or else catch one of them, tie a feather or a\\\\r\\\\nstraw to his leg, which can easily be done (natives thrust it up into his\\\\r\\\\nbody), throw him into the air, and follow him as he flies slowly to his\\\\r\\\\nhive; or catch two bees, and turning them loose at some distance apart,\\\\r\\\\nsearch the place towards which their flights converge. But if bees are\\\\r\\\\ntoo scarce for either of these methods, choose an open place, and lay in\\\\r\\\\nit a plate of syrup as a bait for the bees; after one has fed and flown\\\\r\\\\naway again, remove the plate 200 yards in the direction in which he flew;\\\\r\\\\nand proceed in the same sort of way, until the nest is found.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHoney-bird.--The instinct of the honey-bird is well-known, which induces\\\\r\\\\nhim to lead men to hives, that he may share in the plunder. The stories\\\\r\\\\nthat are told of the apparent malice of the bird, in sometimes tricking a\\\\r\\\\nman, and leading him to the lair of wild animals, instead of to the bees'\\\\r\\\\nnest, are well authenticated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRevolting Food, that may save the Lives of Starving Men.--Suspicion of\\\\r\\\\nPoison.--If any meat that you may find, or if the water of any pool at\\\\r\\\\nwhich you encamp, is under suspicion of being poisoned, let one of your\\\\r\\\\ndogs eat or drink before you do, and wait an hour to watch the effect of\\\\r\\\\nit upon him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarrion is not noxious to Starving Men.--In reading the accounts of\\\\r\\\\ntravellers who have suffered severely from want of food, a striking fact\\\\r\\\\nis common to all, namely, that, under those circumstances, carrion and\\\\r\\\\ngarbage of every kind can be eaten without the stomach rejecting it. Life\\\\r\\\\ncan certainly be maintained on a revolting diet, that would cause a\\\\r\\\\ndangerous illness to a man who was not compelled to adopt it by the pangs\\\\r\\\\nof hunger. There is, moreover, a great difference in the power that\\\\r\\\\ndifferent people possess of eating rank food without being made ill by\\\\r\\\\nit. It appears that no flesh, and very few fish, are poisonous to man;\\\\r\\\\nbut vegetables are frequently poisonous.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDead Animals, to find.--The converging flight of crows, and gorged\\\\r\\\\nvultures sitting on trees, show where dead game is lying; but it is often\\\\r\\\\nvery difficult to find the carcase; for animals usually crawl under some\\\\r\\\\nbush or other hiding-place, to die. Jackal-tracks, etc., are often the\\\\r\\\\nonly guide. It may be advisable, after an unsuccessful search, to remove\\\\r\\\\nto some distance, and watch patiently throughout the day, until the birds\\\\r\\\\nreturn to their food, and mark them down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRank Birds.--When rank birds are shot, they should be skinned, not\\\\r\\\\nplucked; for much of the rankness lies in their skin; or, if unskinned,\\\\r\\\\nthey should be buried for some hours, because earth absorbs the oil that\\\\r\\\\nmakes them rank. Their breast and wings are the least objectionable\\\\r\\\\nparts, and, if there be abundance of food, should alone be cooked. Rank\\\\r\\\\nsea-birds, when caught, put in a coop, and fed with corn, were found by\\\\r\\\\nCaptain Bligh to become fat and well-tasted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSkins.--All old hides or skins of any kind that are not tanned are fit\\\\r\\\\nand good for food; they improve soup by being mixed with it; or they may\\\\r\\\\nbe toasted and hammered. Long boiling would make glue or gelatine of\\\\r\\\\nthem. Many a hungry person has cooked and eaten his sandals or skin\\\\r\\\\nclothing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBones contain a great deal of nourishment, which is got at by boiling\\\\r\\\\nthem, pounding their ends between two stones, and sucking them. There is\\\\r\\\\na revolting account in French history, of a beseiged garrison of\\\\r\\\\nSancerre, in the time of Charles IX., and again subsequently at Paris,\\\\r\\\\nand it may be elsewhere, digging up the graveyards for bones as\\\\r\\\\nsustenance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlood from Live Animals.--The Aliab tribe, who have great herds of cattle\\\\r\\\\non the White Nile, \\\\\\\"not only milk their cows, but they bleed their cattle\\\\r\\\\nperiodically, and boil the blood for food. Driving a lance into a vein in\\\\r\\\\nthe neck, they bleed the animal copiously, which operation is repeated\\\\r\\\\nabout once a month.\\\\\\\" (Sir S. Baker.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlesh from Live Animals.--The truth of Bruce's well-known tale of the\\\\r\\\\nAbyssinians and others occasionally slicing out a piece of a live ox for\\\\r\\\\nfood is sufficiently confirmed. Thus Dr. Beke observes, \\\\\\\"There could be\\\\r\\\\nno doubt of the fact. He had questioned hundreds of natives on the\\\\r\\\\nsubject, and though at first they positively declared the statement to be\\\\r\\\\na lie, many, on being more closely questioned, admitted the possibility\\\\r\\\\nof its truth, for they could not deny that cattle are frequently attacked\\\\r\\\\nby hyaenas, whose practice is to leap on the animals from behind and at\\\\r\\\\nonce begin devouring the hind quarters; and yet, if driven off in time,\\\\r\\\\nthe cattle have still lived.\\\\\\\"--Times, Jan. 167.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is reasonable enough that a small worn-out party should adopt this\\\\r\\\\nplan, when they are travelling in a desert where the absence of water\\\\r\\\\nmakes it impossible to delay, and when they are sinking for want of food.\\\\r\\\\nIf the ox were killed outright there would be material for one meal only,\\\\r\\\\nbecause a worn-out party would be incapable of carrying a load of flesh.\\\\r\\\\nBy the Abyssinian plan the wounded beast continues to travel with the\\\\r\\\\nparty, carrying his carcase that is destined to be turned into butcher's\\\\r\\\\nmeat for their use at a further stage. Of course the idea is very\\\\r\\\\nrevolting, for the animal must suffer as much as the average of the tens\\\\r\\\\nor hundreds of wounded hares and pheasants that are always left among the\\\\r\\\\nbushes after an ordinary English battue. To be sure, the Abyssinian plan\\\\r\\\\nshould only be adopted to save human life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen I travelled in South-West Africa, at one part of my journey a plague\\\\r\\\\nof bush-ticks attacked the roots of my oxen's tails. Their bites made\\\\r\\\\nfestering sores, which ended in some of the tails dropping bodily off. I\\\\r\\\\nheard such accidents were not at all uncommon. The animals did not travel\\\\r\\\\nthe worse for it. Now ox-tail soup is proverbially nutritious.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInsects.--Most kinds of creeping things are eatable, and are used by the\\\\r\\\\nChinese. Locusts and grasshoppers are not at all bad. To prepare them,\\\\r\\\\npull off the legs and wings and roast them with a little grease in an\\\\r\\\\niron dish, like coffee. Even the gnats that swarm on the Shir?River are\\\\r\\\\ncollected by the natives and pressed into cakes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWholesome and poisonous Plants.--No certain rule can be given to\\\\r\\\\ndistinguish wholesome plants from poisonous ones; but it has been\\\\r\\\\nobserved that much the same thing suits the digestion of a bird that\\\\r\\\\nsuits that of a man; and, therefore, that a traveller, who otherwise\\\\r\\\\nwould make trials at haphazard, ought to examine the contents of those\\\\r\\\\nbirds' crops that he may catch or shoot, to give a clue to his\\\\r\\\\nexperiments. The rule has notable exceptions, but in the absence of any\\\\r\\\\nother guide it is a very useful one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe only general rules that botany can give are vague and full of\\\\r\\\\nexceptions: they are, that a great many wholesome plants are found among\\\\r\\\\nthe Cruciferae, or those whose petals are arranged like a Maltese cross,\\\\r\\\\nand that many poisonous ones are found amongst the Umbelliferae.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNettle and Fern.--There are two moderately nutritious plants--nettle and\\\\r\\\\nfern--that are found wild in very many countries: and, therefore, the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing extract from Messrs. Hue and Gabet's 'Travels in Thibet' may be\\\\r\\\\nof service:--\\\\\\\"When the young stems of ferns are gathered, quite tender,\\\\r\\\\nbefore they are covered with down, and while the first leaves are bent\\\\r\\\\nand rolled up in themselves, you have only to boil them in pure water to\\\\r\\\\nrealise a dish of delicious asparagus. We would also recommend the\\\\r\\\\nnettle, which, in our opinion, might be made an advantageous substitute\\\\r\\\\nfor spinach; indeed more than once we proved this by our own experience.\\\\r\\\\nThe nettle should be gathered quite young, when the leaves are perfectly\\\\r\\\\ntender. The plant should be pulled up whole, with a portion of the root.\\\\r\\\\nIn order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues\\\\r\\\\nfrom the points, you should wrap them in linen of close texture. When\\\\r\\\\nonce the nettle is boiled, it is perfectly innocuous; and this vegetable,\\\\r\\\\nso rough in its exterior, becomes a very delicate dish. We were able to\\\\r\\\\nenjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month. Then\\\\r\\\\nthe little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny, and the stems\\\\r\\\\nthemselves grew as hard as wood while the nettle, armed with a long white\\\\r\\\\nbeard, p 203 presented only a menacing and awful aspect.\\\\\\\" The roots of\\\\r\\\\nmany kinds of ferns, perhaps of all of them, are edible. Our poor in\\\\r\\\\nEngland will eat neither fern nor nettle: they say the first is\\\\r\\\\ninnutritious, and the second acrid. I like them both.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeaweed.--Several kinds of seaweed, such as Laver and Irish moss, are\\\\r\\\\neatable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCooking Utensils.--Cookery books.--A book on cooking is of no use at all\\\\r\\\\nin the rougher kinds of travel, for all its recipes consist of phrases\\\\r\\\\nsuch as \\\\\\\"Take a pound of so-and-so, half a pound of something else, a\\\\r\\\\npinch of this, and a handful of that.\\\\\\\" Now in the bush a man has probably\\\\r\\\\nnone of these things--he certainly has not all of them--and, therefore,\\\\r\\\\nthe recipe is worthless.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPots and Kettles.--Cooking apparatus of any degree of complexity, and of\\\\r\\\\nvery portable shapes, can be bought at all military outfitters'; but for\\\\r\\\\nthe bush, and travelling roughly, nothing is better than a light roomy\\\\r\\\\niron pot and a large strong tin kettle. It is disagreeable to make tea in\\\\r\\\\nthe same pot that meat is boiled in; besides, if you have only one\\\\r\\\\nvessel, it takes a longer time to prepare meals. If possible, take a\\\\r\\\\nsecond small tin kettle, both as a reserve against accidents and for the\\\\r\\\\nconvenience of the thing. An iron pot, whose lid is the size of the crown\\\\r\\\\nof a hat, cooks amply enough for three persons at a time, and can,\\\\r\\\\nwithout much inconvenience, be made to do double duty; and, therefore,\\\\r\\\\nthe above articles would do for six men. An iron pot should have very\\\\r\\\\nshort legs, or some blow will break one of them off and leave a hole.\\\\r\\\\nIron kettles far outwear tin ones, but the comparative difficulty of\\\\r\\\\nmaking them boil, and their great weight, are very objectionable. A good\\\\r\\\\ntin kettle, carefully cherished (and it is the interest of the whole\\\\r\\\\nparty to watch over its safety), lasts many months in the bush. Copper is\\\\r\\\\ndangerous; but the recipe is given, further on, for tinning copper\\\\r\\\\nvessels when they require it. Have the handle of the kettle notched or\\\\r\\\\nbored near the place where it joins the body of the kettle, so as to give\\\\r\\\\na holding by which the lid may be tied tightly down; then, if you stuff a\\\\r\\\\nwisp of grass into the spout, the kettle will carry water for a journey.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDamaged Pots.--A pot or kettle with a large hole in its bottom, filled up\\\\r\\\\nwith a piece of wood, has been made to boil water by burying it a little\\\\r\\\\nway in the earth and making the fire round it. A hole in the side of a\\\\r\\\\npot can be botched up with clay or wood, so as not to leave it altogether\\\\r\\\\nuseless.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitutes for Pots and Kettles.--It is possible to boil water over a\\\\r\\\\nslow fire in many kinds of vessels that would be destroyed by a greater\\\\r\\\\ndegree of heat. In bark, wooden, skin, and even paper vessels, it is\\\\r\\\\nquite possible to boil water. The ruder tribes of the Indian Archipelago\\\\r\\\\nuse a bamboo to boil their rice: \\\\\\\"The green cane resisting the fire\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently long for the cooking of one mass of rice.\\\\\\\" (Crawfurd.) If,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, you have no vessel that you choose to expose to the risk of\\\\r\\\\nburning, you must heat stones and drop them into the water it contains;\\\\r\\\\nbut sandstones, especially are apt to shiver and make grit. The Dacota\\\\r\\\\nIndians, and very probably other tribes also, used to boil animals in\\\\r\\\\ntheir own hide. The description runs thus: \\\\\\\"They stuck four stakes in the\\\\r\\\\nground, and tied the four corners of the hide up to them, leaving a\\\\r\\\\nhollow in the middle; three or four gallons of water, and the meat cut up\\\\r\\\\nvery fine, were then put in; three or four hot stones, each the size of a\\\\r\\\\n6-lb. cannon-shot, cooked the whole into a good soup.\\\\\\\" To a fastidious\\\\r\\\\npalate, the soot, dirt, and ashes that are usually mixed up with the\\\\r\\\\nsoup, are objectionable; but these may be avoided by a careful cook, who\\\\r\\\\ndusts and wipes the stones before dropping them in. The specific heat of\\\\r\\\\nstone is much less than that of water, so that the heating power of a\\\\r\\\\nmeasure of stone is only about one-half of that of an equal measure of\\\\r\\\\nequally hot water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGraters are wanted to grate jerked meat. A piece of tin, punched through\\\\r\\\\nwith holes, then bent a little, and nailed to a piece of wood, makes a\\\\r\\\\ngood one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSieves.--Stretch parchment (which see) on a wooden hoop, exactly as on a\\\\r\\\\ndrum-head; let it dry, and prick it with a red-hot iron, else punch it\\\\r\\\\nfull of small holes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlates, to carry.--I have travelled much with plates, knives, forks,\\\\r\\\\netc., for three persons, carried in a flat leather case like a portfolio,\\\\r\\\\nwhich hung from the side of the cook's saddle, and I found it very\\\\r\\\\nconvenient. It was simply a square piece of leather, with a large pocket\\\\r\\\\nfor the metal plates, and other smaller ones for the rest of the things;\\\\r\\\\nit had a flap to tie over it, which was kept down with a button.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCups.--Each of the men, on a riding expedition, should carry his own tin\\\\r\\\\nmug, either tied to his waist or to his saddle. A wooden bowl is the best\\\\r\\\\nvessel for tea, and even for soup, if you have means of frequently\\\\r\\\\nwashing it: tin mugs burn the lips too much. Wooden bowls are always used\\\\r\\\\nin Thibet; they are cut out of the knots that are found in timber.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpoons.--It is easy to replace a lost spoon by cutting a new one out of\\\\r\\\\nhard wood, or by making one of horn. (See \\\\\\\"Horn.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFireplaces for Cooking.--The most elementary fireplace consists of three\\\\r\\\\nstones in a triangle, to support the pot. If stones are not procurable,\\\\r\\\\nthree piles of mud, or three stakes or green-wood driven into the earth,\\\\r\\\\nare an equivalent. Small recesses neatly cut in a bank, one for each\\\\r\\\\nfireplace, are much used, when the fuel is dry and well prepared. A more\\\\r\\\\nelaborate plan is to excavate a shallow saucer-like hole in the ground, a\\\\r\\\\nfoot or eighteen inches in diameter, and kneading the soil so excavated\\\\r\\\\ninto a circular wall, with a doorway in the windward side: the upper\\\\r\\\\nsurface is curved, so as to leave three pointed turrets, upon which the\\\\r\\\\ncooking-vessel rests, as in the sketch. Thus the wind enters at the\\\\r\\\\ndoorway, and the flames issue through the curved depressions at the top,\\\\r\\\\nand lick round the cooking-vessel placed above. The wall is sometimes\\\\r\\\\nbuilt of stones.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrenches and Holes.--In cooking for a large party with a small supply of\\\\r\\\\nfuel, either dig a narrow trench, above which all the pots and kettles\\\\r\\\\nmay stand in a row, and in which the fire is made--the mouth being open\\\\r\\\\nto the wind, and a small chimney built at the other end;--or else dig a\\\\r\\\\nround hole, one foot deep, and place the pots in a ring on its edge, half\\\\r\\\\nresting on the earth, and half overlapping the hole. A space will remain\\\\r\\\\nin the middle of them, and through this the fire must be fed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEsquimaux Lamp.--The cooking of the Esquimaux is wholly effected by stone\\\\r\\\\nlamps, with wicks made of moss, which are so carefully arranged that the\\\\r\\\\nflame gives little or no smoke. Their lamps vary in size from one foot\\\\r\\\\nand a half long to six inches. Each of the bits of moss gives a small but\\\\r\\\\nvery bright flame. The lamp is all in all to the Esquimaux; it dries\\\\r\\\\ntheir clothes, and melts the snow for their drinking-water; its\\\\r\\\\nconstruction is very ingenious; without it they could not have inhabited\\\\r\\\\nthe arctic regions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOvens.--Bedouin Oven.--Dig a hole in the ground; wall and roof it with\\\\r\\\\nstones, leaving small apertures in the top. They make a roaring fire in\\\\r\\\\nand about the oven (the roof having been temporarily removed for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose), and when the stones (including those of the roof) have become\\\\r\\\\nvery hot, sweep away the ashes and strew the inside of the oven with\\\\r\\\\ngrass, or leaves, taking care that whatever is used, has no disagreeable\\\\r\\\\ntaste, else it would be communicated to the flesh. Then put in the meat:\\\\r\\\\nit is a common plan to sew it up in its own skin, which shields it from\\\\r\\\\ndust and at the same time retains its juices from evaporating. Now\\\\r\\\\nreplace the roof, a matter of some difficulty, on account of the stones\\\\r\\\\nbeing hot, and therefore requiring previous rehearsal. Lastly, make the\\\\r\\\\nfire again over the oven and let the baking continue for some hours. An\\\\r\\\\nentire sheep can be baked easily in this way. The same process is used\\\\r\\\\nfor baking vegetables, except with the addition of pouring occasionally\\\\r\\\\nboiling water upon them, through the roof.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGold-digger's Oven.--The figure represents a section of the oven. A hole\\\\r\\\\nor deep notch is dug into the side of a bank, and two flat stones are\\\\r\\\\nslid horizontally, like shelves, into grooves made in the sides of the\\\\r\\\\nhole, as shown in the figure; where it will be observed that the\\\\r\\\\nuppermost stone does not quite reach to the face of the bank, and that\\\\r\\\\nthe lower-most stone does not quite reach to the back of the hole. A fire\\\\r\\\\nof red-hot embers is placed on the floor of the hole; and the bread about\\\\r\\\\nto be baked is laid upon the lowermost stone. Lastly, another flat stone\\\\r\\\\nis used to close the mouth of the oven: it is set with its edge on the\\\\r\\\\nfloor of the hole: it leans forward with the middle of its face resting\\\\r\\\\nagainst the front edge of the lowermost stone, a narrow interval being\\\\r\\\\nleft between its top and the edge of the uppermost stone. This interval\\\\r\\\\nserves as a vent to the hot air from the embers, which takes the course\\\\r\\\\nshown in the figure. The oven should be thoroughly heated before the\\\\r\\\\nbread is put in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaking between two stones.--For baking slices of meat or thin cakes, it\\\\r\\\\nis sufficient to lay one large stone above another with a few pebbles\\\\r\\\\nbetween, to prevent them from touching. Next make a large fire about the\\\\r\\\\nstones until they are thoroughly hot; then sweep away the embers, and\\\\r\\\\ninsert the slices.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnt hills as Ovens.--Where there are no stones of which ovens may be\\\\r\\\\nbuilt, and where there are old white-ant hills, the natives commonly dig\\\\r\\\\nholes in the sides of the ant hills and use them for that purpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nClay Ovens.--I have heard of a very neat construction, built with clay,\\\\r\\\\nin which grass had been kneaded. A fire was lit inside, to dry the work\\\\r\\\\nas it progressed; while the builder placed rings of clay, in tiers, one\\\\r\\\\nabove the other, until a complete dome was made without mould or\\\\r\\\\nframework. Time was allowed for each ring to dry sufficiently, before the\\\\r\\\\nnext one was added.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaking beneath a camp fire.--A small piece of meat, enough for four or\\\\r\\\\nfive people, can be baked by simply scraping a tolerably deep hole under\\\\r\\\\nthe bivouac fire; putting in the meat rolled in the skin to which it is\\\\r\\\\nattached, and covering it with earth and fire. It is a slow process of\\\\r\\\\ncooking, for it requires many hours; but the meat, when done, is soft and\\\\r\\\\njuicy, and the skin gelatinous and excellent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Meat, previously wrapped up in paper or cloth, may be baked in a clay\\\\r\\\\ncase, in any sort of pit or oven, well covered over, and with good\\\\r\\\\neconomy.\\\\\\\" ('Handbook of Field Service.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaking in Pots.--A capital oven is improvised by means of two earthen or\\\\r\\\\nmetal cooking-pots, of which one is placed on the fire, and in it the\\\\r\\\\narticle to be baked; the other pot is put upon its top, as a cover, and\\\\r\\\\nin it a shovelful of red-hot embers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBush Cookery.--Tough Meat.--Hammer it well between two stones before\\\\r\\\\nputting it on the fire, and again when it is half cooked, to separate the\\\\r\\\\nfibres. I have often seen people save themselves much painful\\\\r\\\\nmastication, by hammering at each separate piece of meat, before putting\\\\r\\\\nit in their mouths.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRank Meat.--I have spoken of this, in another section, p. 200.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKabobs.--Broil the rib-bones, or skewer your iron ramrod through a dozen\\\\r\\\\nsmall lumps of meat and roast them. This is the promptest way of cooking\\\\r\\\\nmeat; but men on hard work are not satisfied with a diet of nothing else\\\\r\\\\nbut tough roasted flesh, they crave for succulent food, such as boiled or\\\\r\\\\nbaked meat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalt Meat, to prepare hurriedly.--Warm it slightly on both sides--this\\\\r\\\\nmakes the salt draw to the outside--then rinse it well in a pannikin of\\\\r\\\\nwater. This process extracts a large part of the salt, and leaves the\\\\r\\\\nmeat more fit for cooking.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHaggis.--Hearne, the North American traveller, recommends a \\\\\\\"haggis made\\\\r\\\\nwith blood, a good quantity of fat shred small, some of the tenderest of\\\\r\\\\nthe flesh, together with the heart and lungs, cut or town into small\\\\r\\\\nskivers; all of which is put into the stomach, and roasted by being\\\\r\\\\nsuspended before the fire with a string. Care must be taken that it does\\\\r\\\\nnot get too much heat at first, or it will burst. It is a most delicious\\\\r\\\\nmorsel, even without pepper, salt, or any seasoning.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTheory of Tea-making.--I have made a number of experiments on the art of\\\\r\\\\nmaking good tea. We constantly hear that some people are good and others\\\\r\\\\nbad tea-makers; that it takes a long time to understand the behaviour of\\\\r\\\\na new tea=pot, and so forth; and lastly, that good tea cannot be made\\\\r\\\\nexcept with boiling water. Now, this latter assertion is assuredly\\\\r\\\\nuntrue, because, if tea be actually boiled in water, an emetic and partly\\\\r\\\\npoisonous drink is the certain result. I had a tin lid made to my teapot,\\\\r\\\\na short tube passed through the lid, and in the tube was a cork, through\\\\r\\\\na hole in which a thermometer was fitted, that enabled me to learn the\\\\r\\\\ntemperature of the water in the teapot, at each moment. Thus provided, I\\\\r\\\\ncontinued to make my tea as usual, and to note down what I observed. In\\\\r\\\\nthe first place after warming the teapot in the ordinary way, the fresh\\\\r\\\\nboiling water that was poured into it, sank invariably to under 200\\\\r\\\\ndegrees Fahr. It was usually 180 degrees, so great was the amount of heat\\\\r\\\\nabstracted by the teapot. I also found that my teapot--it was a crockery\\\\r\\\\none--allowed the water within it to cool down at the rate of about 2\\\\r\\\\ndegrees per minute. When the pot was filled afresh, of course the\\\\r\\\\ntemperature of its contents rose afresh, and by the addition of water two\\\\r\\\\nor three times repeated, I obtained a perfect mastery over the\\\\r\\\\ntemperature of the pot, within reasonable limits. Now, after numerous\\\\r\\\\ndays in which I made tea according to my usual method, but measuring\\\\r\\\\nstrictly the quantity of leaves, and recording the times and the\\\\r\\\\ntemperature, and noting the character of tea produced; then, taking as my\\\\r\\\\ntype of excellence, tea that was full bodied, full tasted, and in no way\\\\r\\\\nbitter or flat, I found that this was only produced when the water in the\\\\r\\\\nteapot had remained between 180?and 190 degrees Fahr., and had stood\\\\r\\\\neight minutes on the leaves. It was only necessary for me to add water\\\\r\\\\nonce to the tea, to ensure this temperature. Bitterness was the certain\\\\r\\\\nresult of greater heat or of longer standing, and flatness was the result\\\\r\\\\nof colder water. If the tea did not stand for so long a time as eight\\\\r\\\\nminutes, it was not ripe; it was not full bodied enough. The palate\\\\r\\\\nbecomes far less fastidious about the quality of the second cup. Other\\\\r\\\\npeople may like tea of a different character from that which I do myself;\\\\r\\\\nbut, be that as it may, all people can, I maintain, ensure uniformity of\\\\r\\\\ngood tea, such as they best like, by attending to the principle of making\\\\r\\\\nit--that is to say, to time, and quantities, and temperature. There is\\\\r\\\\nno other mystery in the teapot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTea made in the kettle.--Where there are no cups or teapot put the leaves\\\\r\\\\nin the pot or kettle, and drink through a reed with a wisp of grass in\\\\r\\\\nit, as they do in Paraguay. If there are cups and no teapot, the leaves\\\\r\\\\nmay be put into the pot, previously enclosed in a loose gauze or muslin\\\\r\\\\nbag to prevent their floating about. A contrivance is sold in the shops\\\\r\\\\nfor this purpose; it is made of metal gauze, and shaped like an egg. A\\\\r\\\\npurse made of metal rings would be better, for it would pack flat; but\\\\r\\\\nthe advantage of muslin over metal apparatus is that you may throw away\\\\r\\\\nbag and all, and avoid the trouble of cleaning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTea made in tin mugs.--A correspondent assures me that he considers the\\\\r\\\\nAustralian plan of making tea to be preferable to any other, for\\\\r\\\\ntravellers and explorers; as it secures that the tea shall be made both\\\\r\\\\nwell and quickly, and without the necessity of carrying kettles on\\\\r\\\\nhorseback. Each person has a common tin quart pot and a pint pot, slung\\\\r\\\\nto his saddle; the tea and sugar are carried in small bags. The quart pot\\\\r\\\\nrequires very little fire to make it boil. When it begins to boil, it is\\\\r\\\\ntaken from the fire, the tea is dropped in, and the pint pot is placed on\\\\r\\\\nits top as a cover. When the tea is ready, the sugar is dropped into the\\\\r\\\\npint, and the tea is poured from one pot to the other till it is mixed.\\\\r\\\\nThe pint is always kept clean for drinking out of, but not the quart, for\\\\r\\\\nthe blacker it is, the sooner will the water boil.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTea made over night.--To prepare tea for a very early breakfast, make it\\\\r\\\\nover night, and pour it away from the tea-leaves, into another vessel. It\\\\r\\\\nwill keep perfectly well, for it is by long standing with the tea-leaves\\\\r\\\\nthat it becomes bitter. In the morning simply warm it up. Tea is drunk at\\\\r\\\\na temperature of 140 degrees Fahr., or 90 degrees above an average night\\\\r\\\\ntemperature of 50 degrees. It is more than twice as easy to raise the\\\\r\\\\ntemperature up to 140 than to 212 degrees, letting alone the trouble of\\\\r\\\\ntea-making.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nExtract of Tea and Coffee.--Dr. Rae speaks very highly of the convenience\\\\r\\\\nof extract of tea. Any scientific chemist could make it, but he should be\\\\r\\\\nbegged to use first-rate tea. The extract from first-rate tea makes a\\\\r\\\\nvery drinkable infusion, but that from second-rate tea is not good, the\\\\r\\\\ndrink made from the extract always a grade inferior to that made directly\\\\r\\\\nfrom the leaves. By pouring a small quantity of the extract into warm\\\\r\\\\nwater, the tea is made; and, though inferior in taste to properly made\\\\r\\\\ntea, it has an equally good effect on the digestion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nExtract of coffee is well known. I believe it can be made of very good\\\\r\\\\nquality, but what is usually sold seems to me to be very much the\\\\r\\\\ncontrary and not to be wholesome.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTea and Coffee, without hot water.--In Unyoro, Sir S. Baker says, they\\\\r\\\\nhave no idea of using coffee as a drink, but simply chew it raw as a\\\\r\\\\nstimulant. In Chinese Tartary, travellers who have no means of making a\\\\r\\\\ncup of tea, will chew the leaves as a substitute. Mr. Atkinson told me\\\\r\\\\nhow very grateful he had found this makeshift.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWATER FOR DRINKING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--In most of those countries where travelling is arduous,\\\\r\\\\nit is the daily care of an explorer to obtain water, for his own use and\\\\r\\\\nfor that of his caravan. Should he be travelling in regions that are for\\\\r\\\\nthe most part arid and rarely visited by showers, he must look for his\\\\r\\\\nsupplies in ponds made by the drainage of a large extent of country, or\\\\r\\\\nin those left here and there along the beds of partly dried-up\\\\r\\\\nwater-courses, or in fountains. If he be unsuccessful in his search, or\\\\r\\\\nwhen the dry season of the year has advanced, and all water has\\\\r\\\\ndisappeared from the surface of the land, there remains no alternative\\\\r\\\\nfor him but to dig wells where there are marks to show that pools\\\\r\\\\nformerly lay, or where there are other signs that well-water may be\\\\r\\\\nobtained.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShort Stages.--I may here remark that it is a good general rule for an\\\\r\\\\nexplorer of an arid country, when he happens to come to water, after not\\\\r\\\\nless than three hours' travelling, to stop and encamp by it; it is better\\\\r\\\\nfor him to avail himself of his good fortune and be content with his\\\\r\\\\nday's work, than to risk the uncertainty of another supply.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPurity of Watering-places.--Make no litter by the side of\\\\r\\\\nwatering-places; and encourage among your party the Mahomedan feeling of\\\\r\\\\nrespect for preserving the purity of drinking-water. Old travellers\\\\r\\\\ncommonly encamp at a distance from the watering-place, and fetch the\\\\r\\\\nwater to their camp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSigns of the Neighbourhood of Water.--The quick intelligence with which\\\\r\\\\nexperienced travellers discover watering-places, is so great that it\\\\r\\\\nmight almost be mistaken for an instinct.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIntelligence of Dogs and Cattle.--Dogs are particularly clever in\\\\r\\\\nfinding water, and the fact of a dog looking refreshed, and it may be\\\\r\\\\nwet, has often and often drawn attention to a pond that would otherwise\\\\r\\\\nhave been overlooked and passed by. Cattle are very uncertain in their\\\\r\\\\nintelligence. Sometimes oxen go for miles and miles across a country\\\\r\\\\nunknown to them, straight to a pond of water; at other times they are\\\\r\\\\nmost obtuse: Dr. Leichhardt, the Australian traveller, was quite\\\\r\\\\nastonished at their stupidity in this respect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrees and ordinary vegetation are not of much help in directing a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller to water, for they thrive on dew or on occasional rain; but it\\\\r\\\\nis otherwise when the vegetation is unusually green or luxuriant, or when\\\\r\\\\nthe vegetation is unusually green or luxuriant, or when those trees are\\\\r\\\\nremarked, that are seldom seen to grow except near water in the\\\\r\\\\nparticular country visited, as the blackthorn-tree in South Africa.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBirds.--Some species of birds (as water-fowl, parrots, and the diamond\\\\r\\\\nbird) or animals (as baboons) afford surer promise; but the converging\\\\r\\\\nflight of birds, or the converging fresh tracks of animals, is the most\\\\r\\\\nsatisfactory sign of all. It is about nightfall that desert birds usually\\\\r\\\\ndrink, and hence it often happens that the exhausted traveller,\\\\r\\\\nabandoning all hope as the shades of evening close in, has his attention\\\\r\\\\narrested by flights of birds, that give him new life and tell him where\\\\r\\\\nto go.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTracks.--In tropical countries that have rainy and dry Seasons, it must\\\\r\\\\nbe recollected that old paths of men or wild animals only mislead; they\\\\r\\\\ngo to dry ponds that were full at the time they were trodden, but have\\\\r\\\\nsince been abandoned on becoming exhausted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Signs.--Well-water may be sought where the earth is still moist,\\\\r\\\\nthough arid all around, or, failing that, where birds and wild animals\\\\r\\\\nhave lately been scratching, or where gnats hover in swarms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo find the Spring--From the number of birds, tracks, and other signs,\\\\r\\\\ntravellers are often pretty sure that they are near water, but cannot\\\\r\\\\nfind the spring itself. In this case the party should at once be spread\\\\r\\\\nout as skirmishers, and the dogs cheered on.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo probe for Well-water.--It is unusual, when no damp earth can be seen,\\\\r\\\\nbut where the place appears likely to yield well-water, to force an iron\\\\r\\\\nramrod deep into the soil; and, if it bring up any grains that are moist,\\\\r\\\\nto dig.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPools of Water.--For many days after there has been rain, water is sure\\\\r\\\\nto be found among mountains, however desert may be their appearance; for\\\\r\\\\nnot only does more wet fall upon them, but the drainage is more perfect;\\\\r\\\\nlong after the ravines and stream-beds are quite dry, puddles and cupfuls\\\\r\\\\nof water will be found here and there, along their courses, in holes and\\\\r\\\\nchinks and under great stones, which together form a sufficiency. A\\\\r\\\\nsponge tied to the end of a stick will do good service in lapping these\\\\r\\\\nup.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe sandy Beds of Watercourses in arid countries frequently contain pools\\\\r\\\\nof stagnant water; but the places where these pools are to be found are\\\\r\\\\nnot necessarily those where they have been found in preceding years. The\\\\r\\\\nconditions necessary for the existence of a pool are not alone those of\\\\r\\\\nthe rocky substratum of the river-bed, but more especially, the\\\\r\\\\nstratifications of mud and clay left after each flooding. For instance,\\\\r\\\\nan extensive bed of sand, enclosed between two layers of clay, would\\\\r\\\\nremain moist, and supply well-water during the dry season; but a trivial\\\\r\\\\nvariation in the force and Amount of the current, in different years,\\\\r\\\\nmight materially affect the place and the character of the deposition of\\\\r\\\\nthese clay strata.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn searching the beds of partly dried-up watercourses, the fact must\\\\r\\\\nnever be forgotten, that it is especially in little tributaries at the\\\\r\\\\npoint where they fall into the main one, that most water is to be found;\\\\r\\\\nand the most insignificant of these should never be overlooked. I presume\\\\r\\\\nthat the bar, which always accumulates in front of tributaries, and is\\\\r\\\\nformed of numerous layers of alluvial deposit, parallel to the bed of the\\\\r\\\\ngreat stream, is very likely to have one, at least, of its layers of an\\\\r\\\\nimpervious character. If so, the bar would shut in the wet sand of the\\\\r\\\\ntributary, like a wall, and prevent it from draining itself dry.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen a river-bed has been long followed by a traveller, and a frequent\\\\r\\\\nsupply of water found along it, in pools or even in wells, say at every 5\\\\r\\\\nor 10 miles--then, should this river-bed appear to lose itself in a\\\\r\\\\nplain that is arid, there is no reason why the traveller should be\\\\r\\\\ndisheartened; for, on travelling further, the water will be sure to be\\\\r\\\\nfound again, those plains being always green and grassy where the water\\\\r\\\\nin such river-beds entirely disappears.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy Sea-shore.--Fresh water is frequently to be found under the very\\\\r\\\\nsands of the sea-shore, whither it has oozed underground from the upper\\\\r\\\\ncountry, and where it overlies the denser salt water; or else abuts\\\\r\\\\nagainst it, if the compactness of the sand resists free percolation. In\\\\r\\\\nvery many places along the skirt of the great African desert, fresh water\\\\r\\\\nis to be found by digging two or three feet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFountains.--Fountains in arid lands are as godsends. They are far more\\\\r\\\\nnumerous and abundant in limestone districts than in any others, owing to\\\\r\\\\nthe frequent fissures of those rocks: therefore, whenever limestone crops\\\\r\\\\nout in the midst of sand deserts, a careful search should be made for\\\\r\\\\nwater. In granite, and other primary rocks, many, but small springs, are\\\\r\\\\nusually seen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe theory of ordinary fountains is simple enough, and affords help in\\\\r\\\\ndiscovering them. In a few words, it is as follows:--All the water that\\\\r\\\\nruns from them has originally Been supplied by rain, dew, or fog-damp,\\\\r\\\\nfalling on the face of the land and sinking into it. But the subsoil and\\\\r\\\\nrocks below, are far from being of a uniform character: they are full of\\\\r\\\\nlayers of every imaginable degree of sponginess. Strata of clay wholly\\\\r\\\\nimpenetrable by water, often divide beds of gravel that imbibe it freely.\\\\r\\\\nThere are also cracks that make continuous channels and dislocations that\\\\r\\\\ncause them to end abruptly; and there are rents, filled with various\\\\r\\\\nmaterials, that may either give a free passage or entirely bar the\\\\r\\\\nunderground course of water. Hence, when water has sunk into the earth,\\\\r\\\\nit does not by any means soak through it in an equable degree. It is an\\\\r\\\\neasier matter for it to ooze many miles, along a layer of gravel, than to\\\\r\\\\npenetrate six inches into a layer of clay that may bound the gravel.\\\\r\\\\nTherefore, whenever a porous earth or a fissured rock crops out to the\\\\r\\\\nlight of day, there is, in ignorance of all other facts, some chance of a\\\\r\\\\nspring being discovered in the lowest part of the outcrop. A favourable\\\\r\\\\ncondition for the existence of a large and permanent fountain, is where a\\\\r\\\\nporous stratum spreads over a broad area at a high level, and is\\\\r\\\\nprolonged, by a gradually narrowing course, to an outlet at a lower one.\\\\r\\\\nThe broad upper part of the stratum catches plenty of water during the\\\\r\\\\nwet season, which sinks into the depths as into a reservoir, and oozes\\\\r\\\\nout in a regular stream at its lower outlet. A fissured rock makes a\\\\r\\\\nstill easier channel for the water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig. 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs examples of ordinary cases of fountains, we will take those\\\\r\\\\nrepresented in the following figures. Fig. I is a mountain. Fig. 2 is a\\\\r\\\\nmodel, made to explain more clearly the conditions represented in fig. I.\\\\r\\\\nIt will be observed that there is a ravine, R, in front; a line of fault,\\\\r\\\\nL, M. N, on its left side, Supposed to be filled with water-tight rock;\\\\r\\\\nand a valley, V (fig. 1), on the extreme right. The upper part of the\\\\r\\\\nmountain is supposed to be much more porous than its base, and the plane\\\\r\\\\nwhich divides the porous from the non-porous rock, to cut the surface of\\\\r\\\\nthe mountain along the line, A, N, M, B, C, D, E, F. The highest point of\\\\r\\\\nthe plane is F, and the lowest point A. The effect of rain upon the model\\\\r\\\\nfig. 2 would be, to wet its upper half: water would ooze out along the\\\\r\\\\nwhole of the lines A, N, and M, B, C, D, E, F; and there would be a small\\\\r\\\\nfountain at A, and a large one at M. But in the actual mountain, fig. 1,\\\\r\\\\nwe should not expect to find the same regularity as in the model. The\\\\r\\\\nrind of the earth, with its vegetation and weather-impacted surface,\\\\r\\\\nforms a comparatively impermeable envelope to the mountain, not likely to\\\\r\\\\nbe broken through, except at a few places. But ravines, such as r, would\\\\r\\\\nbe probably denuded of their rind, and there we should find a line of\\\\r\\\\nminute fountains at the base of the porous rock. If there be no actual\\\\r\\\\nfountains, there would at least be some vegetation that indicated\\\\r\\\\ndripping water: thus the appearance is well known and often described, of\\\\r\\\\na ravine utterly bare of verdure above, but clothed with vegetation below\\\\r\\\\na sharply defined line, whence the moisture proceeds that irrigates all\\\\r\\\\nbeneath. We should also be almost certain of finding a spring breaking\\\\r\\\\nforth near m or even near a. But in the valley V we should only see a few\\\\r\\\\nsigns of former moisture, along e, f; such as bunches of vegetation upon\\\\r\\\\nthe arid cliff, or an efflorescence of salts. Whenever a traveller\\\\r\\\\nremarks these signs, he should observe the inclination of the strata, by\\\\r\\\\nwhich he would learn the position of m, where the probability of finding\\\\r\\\\nwater is the greatest. In a very arid country, the anatomy of the land is\\\\r\\\\nso manifest, from the absence of mould, that geological indications are\\\\r\\\\npeculiarly easy to follow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWells.--Digging Wells.--In default of spades, water is to be dug for\\\\r\\\\nwith a sharp-pointed stick. Take it in both hands, and, holding it\\\\r\\\\nupright like a dagger, stab and dig it in the ground, as in fig. 1; then\\\\r\\\\nclear out the loose earth with the hand, as in fig. 2. Continue thus\\\\r\\\\nworking with the stick and hand alternately, and a hole as deep as the\\\\r\\\\narm is easily made. In digging a large hole or well, the earth Must be\\\\r\\\\nloosened in precisely the same manner, handed up to the surface and\\\\r\\\\ncarried off by means of a bucket or bag, in default of a shovel and\\\\r\\\\nwheelbarrow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 1. And Fig. 2.--sketches of digging as described above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter digging deeply, the sand will often be found just moist, no water\\\\r\\\\nactually lying in the well; but do not, therefore, be disheartened; wait\\\\r\\\\na while, and the water will collect. After it has once begun to ooze\\\\r\\\\nthrough the sides of the well, it will continue to do so much more\\\\r\\\\nfreely. Therefore, on arriving at night, with thirsty cattle, at a well\\\\r\\\\nof doubtful character, deepen it at once, by torch-light, that the water\\\\r\\\\nmay have time to collect; then the cattle may be watered in the early\\\\r\\\\nmorning, and sent to feed before the sun is hot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt often happens when digging wells in sandy watercourses, that a little\\\\r\\\\nwater is found, and that below it is a stratum of clay. Now if the\\\\r\\\\ndigging be continued deeper, in hopes of more water, the result is often\\\\r\\\\nmost unfortunate; for the clay stratum may prove extremely thin, in which\\\\r\\\\ncase the digging will pierce it: then the water that had been seen will\\\\r\\\\ndrain rapidly and wholly away, to the utter discomfiture of the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKerkari.--I am indebted to correspondents for an account of a method\\\\r\\\\nemployed in the plains of the Sikhim Himalaya, and in Assam, where it is\\\\r\\\\ncalled a \\\\\\\"Kerkari,\\\\\\\" also in lower Bengal, for digging deep holes. The\\\\r\\\\nnatives take a freshly cut bamboo, say three inches in diameter: they cut\\\\r\\\\nit just above one of the knots, and then split the wood as far as to the\\\\r\\\\nnext joint, in about a dozen places, and point the pieces somewhat. The\\\\r\\\\nother end of the instrument should be cut slantingly, to thrust into the\\\\r\\\\nearth, and its other end is afterwards worked vertically with both hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Unlabelled figure of kerkari].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe soft soil is thus forced into the hollow of the bamboo, and spreads\\\\r\\\\nout its blades, as is intended to be shown in the figure. The bamboo is\\\\r\\\\nnext withdrawn and the plug of earth is shaken out: it is then\\\\r\\\\nreintroduced and worked up and down as before. It is usual to drive a\\\\r\\\\nstake in the ground to act as a toothed comb, to comb out the plug of\\\\r\\\\nearth. Mr. Peal writes from Assam:--\\\\\\\"I have just had 4 holes dug in the\\\\r\\\\ncourse of ordinary work, in hard earth. Two men dug the holes in 1 1/2\\\\r\\\\nhour; they were 3 feet 6 inches deep and 6 inches in diameter. I weighed\\\\r\\\\nthe clay raised at each stroke. In 4 consecutive strokes the weights were\\\\r\\\\n1 1/4 lbs., 1 3/4 lbs., 1 3/4 lbs., 2 lbs. Another trial gave 7 lbs.\\\\r\\\\nlifted, after 5 or 6 strokes.\\\\\\\" According to the above data, an Assamese\\\\r\\\\nworkman makes a hole, 1 foot deep and 6 inches in diameter in 6 minutes.\\\\r\\\\nHoles 10 feet deep and 6 inches wide can be made, as I am informed, by\\\\r\\\\nthis contrivance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProtecting Wells.--The following extract from Bishop Heber, though\\\\r\\\\nhardly within the scope of the 'Art of Travel,' is very suggestive. \\\\\\\"The\\\\r\\\\nwells of this country (Bhurtpoor, India), some of which are very deep,\\\\r\\\\nare made in a singular manner. They build a tower of masonry of the\\\\r\\\\ndiameter required, and 20 or 30 feet high from the surface of the ground.\\\\r\\\\nThis they allow to stand a year or more, till its masonry is rendered\\\\r\\\\nfirm and compact by time; then they gradually undermine it, and promote\\\\r\\\\nits sinking into the sandy soil, which it does without difficulty, and\\\\r\\\\naltogether. When level with the surface, they raise its walls higher; and\\\\r\\\\nso go on, throwing out the sand and raising the wall, till they have\\\\r\\\\nreached the water. If they adopted our method, the soil is so light that\\\\r\\\\nit would fall on them before they could possibly raise the wall from the\\\\r\\\\nbottom; nor, without the wall, could they sink to any considerable\\\\r\\\\ndepth.\\\\\\\" A stout square frame of wood scantling, boarded like a\\\\r\\\\nsentry-box, and of about the same size and shape, but without top or\\\\r\\\\nbottom, is used in making wells in America. The sides of a well in sandy\\\\r\\\\nsoil are so liable to fall in, that travellers often sink a cask or some\\\\r\\\\nequivalent into the water, when they are encamped for any length of time\\\\r\\\\nin its vicinity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScanty wells in hot climates should be brushed over, when not in actual\\\\r\\\\nuse, to check their evaporation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSnow-water.--It is impossible for men to sustain life by eating snow or\\\\r\\\\nice, instead of drinking water. They only aggravate the raging torments\\\\r\\\\nof thirst, instead of assuaging them, and hasten death. Among dogs, the\\\\r\\\\nEsquimaux is the only breed that can subsist on snow, as an equivalent\\\\r\\\\nfor water. The Arctic animals, generally, have the same power. But, as\\\\r\\\\nregards mankind, some means of melting snow into water, for the purposes\\\\r\\\\nof drinking, is an essential condition of life in the Arctic regions.\\\\r\\\\nWithout the ingenious Esquimaux lamp (p. 205), which consists of a circle\\\\r\\\\nof moss wicks, fed by train-oil, and chiefly used for melting snow, the\\\\r\\\\nEsquimaux could not exist throughout the year, in the countries which\\\\r\\\\nthey now inhabit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat eating large quantities of snow should seriously disturb the animal\\\\r\\\\nsystem is credible enough, when we consider the very large amount of heat\\\\r\\\\nthat must be abstracted from the stomach, in order to melt it. A mouthful\\\\r\\\\nof snow at 32 degrees Fahr., that is to say, no colder than is necessary\\\\r\\\\nfor it to be snow at all, robs as much heat from the stomach, as if the\\\\r\\\\nmouthful had been of water 143 degrees colder than ice-cold water, if\\\\r\\\\nsuch a fluid may, for the moment, be imagined to exist. For the \\\\\\\"latent\\\\r\\\\nheat\\\\\\\" of water is 143 degrees Fahr. In other words, it takes the same\\\\r\\\\nquantity of heat to convert a mass of snow of 32 degrees into water of\\\\r\\\\n32? as it does to raise the same mass of water from 32 degrees to 141?+\\\\r\\\\n32 degrees = 175 degrees Fahr. It takes in practice about as long to melt\\\\r\\\\nsnow of a low temperature into water, as it does to cause that same water\\\\r\\\\nto boil. Thus to raise snow of 5 degrees below zero Fahr. To 32 degrees,\\\\r\\\\ntakes 37 degrees of heat, and it requires 143 degrees more, or 180\\\\r\\\\ndegrees altogether, to melt it into water. Also it requires 180 degrees\\\\r\\\\nto convert water of 32 degrees into water of 212 degrees, in other words,\\\\r\\\\ninto boiling water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDistilled Water.--It will take six or seven times as long to convert a\\\\r\\\\nkettle full of boiling-water into steam, as it did to make that kettle\\\\r\\\\nboil. For the \\\\\\\"latent heat\\\\\\\" of steam is 967 degrees Fahr.; therefore, if\\\\r\\\\nthe water that was put into the kettle was 60 degrees, it would require\\\\r\\\\nto be raised through (212 degrees--60?degrees =) 152?degrees of\\\\r\\\\ntemperature in order to make it begin to boil; and it would require a\\\\r\\\\nfurther quantity of heat, to the extent of 967 degrees (= about 6 1/2\\\\r\\\\ntimes 152 degrees), to boil it all away. Hence, it is of no use to\\\\r\\\\nattempt to distil, until you have provided abundance of good firewood of\\\\r\\\\na fit size to burn quickly, and have built an efficient fireplace on\\\\r\\\\nwhich to set the kettle. Unfortunately, fuel is commonly deficient in\\\\r\\\\nthose places where there is a lack of fresh water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRate of Distillation.--A drop per second is fully equivalent To an\\\\r\\\\nimperial pint of water in three hours, or be an imperial gallon in an\\\\r\\\\nentire day and night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe simplest way to distil, but a very imperfect one, is to light a fire\\\\r\\\\namong stones, near a hollow in a rock, that is filled, or can be filled\\\\r\\\\nwith salt-water. When the stones are red-hot, drop them one by one into\\\\r\\\\nit: the water will hiss and give out clouds of vapour, some of which may\\\\r\\\\nbe collected in a cloth, and wrung or sucked out of it. In the same way a\\\\r\\\\npot on the fire may have a cloth stretched over it to catch the steam.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of still as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStill made with a Kettle and Gun-barrel.--There is an account of the\\\\r\\\\ncrew of the 'Levant' packet, which was wrecked near the cosmoledo\\\\r\\\\nIslands, who supplied themselves with fresh water by means of\\\\r\\\\ndistillation alone, and whose Still was contrived with an iron pot and a\\\\r\\\\ngun-barrel, found on the spot where they were wrecked. They procured, On\\\\r\\\\nthe average, sixty bottles, or ten gallons, of distilled water in each\\\\r\\\\ntwenty-four hours. \\\\\\\"The iron pot was converted into a boiler to contain\\\\r\\\\nsalt water; a lid was fitted to it out of the root of a tree, leaving a\\\\r\\\\nhole of sufficient size to receive the muzzle of the gun-barrel, which\\\\r\\\\nwas to set as a steampipe; the barrel was run through the stump of a\\\\r\\\\ntree, hollowed out in the middle, and kept full of cold water for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose of condensation; and the water so distilled escaped at the nipple\\\\r\\\\nof the gun-barrel, and was conducted into a bottle placed to receive it.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nThe accompanying sketch is taken from a model which I made, with a\\\\r\\\\nsoldier's mess-tin for a boiler, and a tin tube in the place of a gun\\\\r\\\\nbarrel. The knob represents the breech; and the projection, through which\\\\r\\\\nthe water is dropping, the nipple. I may remark that there is nothing in\\\\r\\\\nthe arrangement which would hurt the most highly-finished gun barrel; and\\\\r\\\\nthat the trough which holds the condensing water may be made with canvas,\\\\r\\\\nor even dispensed with altogether.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCondensing Pipe.--In default of other tubes, a reed may be used: one of\\\\r\\\\nthe long bones of an animal, or of a wading bird, will be an indifferent\\\\r\\\\nsubstitute for a condensing pipe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStill, made with Earthen Pots and a Metal Basin.--A very simple\\\\r\\\\ndistilling apparatus is used in Bhootan; the sketch will show the\\\\r\\\\nprinciple on which it is constructed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of apparatus].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalt water is placed in a pot, set over the fire. Another vessel, but\\\\r\\\\nwithout top or bottom, which, for the convenience of illustration, I have\\\\r\\\\nindicated in the sketch by nothing more than a dotted line, is made to\\\\r\\\\nstand upon the pot. It serves as a support for a metal basin, S, which is\\\\r\\\\nfilled with salt water, and acts as a condenser. When the pot boils, the\\\\r\\\\nsteam ascends and condenses itself on the under surface of the basin S,\\\\r\\\\nwhence it drops down and is Collected in a cup, C, that is supported by a\\\\r\\\\nrude tripod of sticks, T, standing in the inside of the iron pot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOccasional Means of Quenching Thirst.--A Shower of Rain will yield a\\\\r\\\\ngood supply. The clothes may be stripped off and spread out, and the\\\\r\\\\nrain-water sucked from them. Or, when a storm is approaching a cloth or\\\\r\\\\nblanket may be made fast by its four corners, and a quantity of bullets\\\\r\\\\nthrown in the middle of it; they will cause the water that it receives,\\\\r\\\\nto drain to one point and trickle through the cloth, into a cup or bucket\\\\r\\\\nset below. A reversed umbrella will catch water; but the first drippings\\\\r\\\\nfrom it, or from clothes that have been long unwashed, as from a\\\\r\\\\nmacintosh cloak, are intolerably nauseous and very unwholesome. It must\\\\r\\\\nbe remembered, that thirst is greatly relieved by the skin being wetted,\\\\r\\\\nand therefore it is well for a man suffering from thirst, to strip to the\\\\r\\\\nrain. Rain-water is lodged for some days in the huge pitcher-like\\\\r\\\\ncorollas of many tropical flowers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSea-water.--Lives of sailors have more than once been saved when turned\\\\r\\\\nadrift in a boat, by bathing frequently and keeping their clothes damp\\\\r\\\\nwith salt-water. However, after some days, the nauseous taste of the\\\\r\\\\nsalt-water is very perceptible in the saliva, and at last becomes\\\\r\\\\nunbearable; such, at least was the experience of the surgeon of the\\\\r\\\\nwrecked 'Pandora.'\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDew-water is abundant near the sea-shore, and may be collected in the\\\\r\\\\nsame way as rain-water. The storehouse at Angra Pequeï¿½a, in S. W. Africa,\\\\r\\\\nin 1850, was entirely supplied by the dew-water deposited on its roof.\\\\r\\\\nThe Australians who live near the sea, go among the wet bushes with a\\\\r\\\\ngreat piece of bark, and brush into it the dew-drops from the leaves with\\\\r\\\\na wisp of grass; collecting in this way large quantities of water. Eyre\\\\r\\\\nused a sponge for the same purpose, and appears to have saved his life by\\\\r\\\\nits use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnimal Fluids are resorted to in emergencies; such as the contents of the\\\\r\\\\npaunch of an animal that has been shot; its taste is like sweet-wort. Mr.\\\\r\\\\nDarwin writes of people who, catching turtles, drank the water that was\\\\r\\\\nfound in their Pericardia; it was pure and sweet. Blood will stand in the\\\\r\\\\nstead of solid food, but it is of no avail in the stead of water, on\\\\r\\\\naccount of its saline qualities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVegetable Fluids.--Many roots exist, from which both natives and animals\\\\r\\\\nobtain a sufficiency of sap and pulp, to take the place of water. The\\\\r\\\\ntraveller should inquire of the natives, and otherwise acquaint himself\\\\r\\\\nwith those peculiar to the country that he visits; such as the roots\\\\r\\\\nwhich the eland eats, the bitter water-melon, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo purify water that is muddy or putrid.--With muddy water, the remedy\\\\r\\\\nis to filter, and to use alum, if you have it. With putrid, to boil, to\\\\r\\\\nmix with charcoal, or expose to the sun and air; or what is best, to use\\\\r\\\\nall three methods at the same time. When the water is salt or brackish,\\\\r\\\\nnothing avails but distillation. (See Distilled Water,\\\\\\\" p. 218.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo filter Muddy Water.--When, at the watering-place, there is little\\\\r\\\\nelse but a mess of mud and filth, take a good handful of grass or rushes,\\\\r\\\\nand tie it roughly together in the form of a cone, 6 or 8 inches long;\\\\r\\\\nthen dipping the broad end into the puddle, and turning it up, a\\\\r\\\\nstreamlet of fluid will trickle down through the small end. This\\\\r\\\\nexcellent plan is used by the Northern Bushmen--at their wells\\\\r\\\\nquantities of these bundles are found lying about. (Anderson.) Otherwise\\\\r\\\\nsuck water through your handkerchief by putting it over the mouth of your\\\\r\\\\nmug, or by throwing it on the gritty mess as it lies in the puddle. For\\\\r\\\\nobtaining a copious supply, the most perfect plan, if you have means, is\\\\r\\\\nto bore a cask full of auger holes, and put another small one, that has\\\\r\\\\nhad the bottom knocked out, inside it; and then to fill the space between\\\\r\\\\nthe two, with grass, moss, etc. Sink the whole in the midst of the pond;\\\\r\\\\nthe water will run through the auger-holes, filter through the moss, and\\\\r\\\\nrise in the inner cask clear of weeds and sand. If you have only a single\\\\r\\\\ncask, holes may be bored in the lower part of its sides, and alternate\\\\r\\\\nlayers of sand and grass thrown in, till they cover the holes; through\\\\r\\\\nthese layers, the water will strain. Or any coarse bag, kept open with\\\\r\\\\nhoops made on the spot, may be moored in the mud, by placing a heavy\\\\r\\\\nstone inside; it will act on The same principle, but less efficiently\\\\r\\\\nthan the casks. Sand, charcoal, sponge, and wood, are the substances most\\\\r\\\\ncommonly used in properly constructed filters: peat charcoal is\\\\r\\\\nexcellent. Charcoal acts not only as a mechanical filter for solid\\\\r\\\\nimpurities, but it has the further advantage of absorbing putrid gases.\\\\r\\\\n(See below, \\\\\\\"Putrid Water.\\\\\\\") Snow is also used as a filter in the Arctic\\\\r\\\\nregions. Dr. Rae used to lay it on the water, until it was considerably\\\\r\\\\nhigher than its level, and then to suck the water through the snow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlum.--Turbid water is also, in some way as yet insufficiently\\\\r\\\\nexplained, made clear by the Indian plan of putting a piece of alum into\\\\r\\\\nit. The alum appears to unite with the mud, and to form a clayey deposit.\\\\r\\\\nIndependently of the action, it has an astringent effect upon organic\\\\r\\\\nmatters: it hardens them, and they subside to the bottom of the vessel\\\\r\\\\ninstead of being diffused in a glairy, viscous state, throughout the\\\\r\\\\nwater. No taste of alum remains in the water, unless it has been used in\\\\r\\\\ngreat excess. Three thimblefuls of alum will clarify a bucketful of\\\\r\\\\nturbid water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPutrid Water should always be purified by boiling it together with\\\\r\\\\ncharcoal or charred sticks, as low fevers and dysenteries too often are\\\\r\\\\nthe consequences of drinking it. The mere addition of charcoal largely\\\\r\\\\ndisinfects it. Bitter herbs, if steeped in putrid water, or even rubbed\\\\r\\\\nwell about the cup, are said to render it less unwholesome. The Indians\\\\r\\\\nplunge hot iron into putrid water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThirst, to relieve.--Thirst is a fever of the palate, which may be\\\\r\\\\nsomewhat relieved by other means than drinking fluids.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy exciting Saliva.--The mouth is kept moist, and thirst is mitigated,\\\\r\\\\nby exciting the saliva to flow. This can be done by chewing something, as\\\\r\\\\na leaf; or by keeping in the mouth a bullet, or a smooth, non-absorbent\\\\r\\\\nstone, such as a quartz pebble.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy Fat or Butter.--In Australia, Africa, and N. America, it is a\\\\r\\\\nfrequent custom to carry a small quantity of fat or butter, and to eat a\\\\r\\\\nspoonful at a time, when the thirst is severe. These act on the irritated\\\\r\\\\nmembranes of the mouth and throat, just as cold cream upon chapped hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy Salt Water.--People may live long without drinking, if they have\\\\r\\\\nmeans of keeping their skin constantly wet with water, even though it be\\\\r\\\\nsalt or otherwise undrinkable. A traveller may tie a handkerchief wetted\\\\r\\\\nwith salt water round his neck. See p. 223.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy checking Evaporation.--The Arabs keep their mouths covered with a\\\\r\\\\ncloth, in order to prevent the sense of thirst caused by the lips being\\\\r\\\\nparched.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy Diet.--Drink well before starting, and make a habit of drinking only\\\\r\\\\nat long intervals, and then, plenty at a time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn giving Water to Persons nearly dead from Thirst.--Give a little at a\\\\r\\\\ntime, let them take it in spoonfuls; for the large draughts that their\\\\r\\\\ndisordered instincts suggest, disarrange the weakened stomach: they do\\\\r\\\\nserious harm, and no corresponding good. Keep the whole body wet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Water Vessels.--General Remarks on Carrying Water.--People drink\\\\r\\\\nexcessively in hot dry climates, as the evaporation from the skin is\\\\r\\\\nenormous, and must be counterbalanced. Under these circumstances the\\\\r\\\\ndaily ration of a European is at least two quarts. To make an exploring\\\\r\\\\nexpedition in such countries efficient, there should be means of carrying\\\\r\\\\nat least one gallon of water for each white man; and in unknown lands\\\\r\\\\nthis quantity should be carried on from every watering-place, so long as\\\\r\\\\nmeans can possibly be obtained for carrying it, and should be served out\\\\r\\\\nthus:--two quarts on the first day, in addition to whatever private store\\\\r\\\\nthe men may have chosen to carry for themselves; a quart and a half\\\\r\\\\nduring the second day; and half a quart on the morning of the third,\\\\r\\\\nwhich will carry them through that day without distress. Besides\\\\r\\\\nwater-vessels sufficient for carrying what I have mentioned, there ought\\\\r\\\\nto be others for the purpose of leaving water buried in the ground, as a\\\\r\\\\nstore for the return of a reconnoitring expedition; also each man should\\\\r\\\\nbe furnished with a small water-vessel of some kind or other for his own\\\\r\\\\nuse, and should be made to take care of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFill the Water-vessels.--\\\\\\\"Never mind what the natives may tell you\\\\r\\\\nconcerning the existence of water on the road, believe nothing, but\\\\r\\\\nresolutely determine to fill the girbas (water-vessels).\\\\\\\" (Baker.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Water-vessels.--No expedition should start without being fully\\\\r\\\\nsupplied with these; for no bushman however ingenious, can make anything\\\\r\\\\nso efficient as casks, tin vessels or macintosh bags.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of water-vessel].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA tin vessel of the shape shown in the sketch, and large enough to hold a\\\\r\\\\nquart, is, I believe, the easiest to carry, the cleanest, and the most\\\\r\\\\ndurable of small water-vessels. The curve in its shape is to allow of its\\\\r\\\\naccommodating itself to the back of the man who carries it. The tin loops\\\\r\\\\nat its sides are to admit the strap by which it is to be slung, and which\\\\r\\\\npasses through the loops underneath the bottom of the vessel, so that the\\\\r\\\\nweight may rest directly upon the strap. Lastly, the vessel has a pipette\\\\r\\\\nfor drinking through, and a larger hole by which it is to be filled, and\\\\r\\\\nwhich at other times is stopped with a cork or wooden plug. When drinking\\\\r\\\\nout of the pipette, the cork must be loosened in order to admit air, like\\\\r\\\\na vent hole. Macintosh bags, for wine or water, are very convenient to\\\\r\\\\ncarry and they will remain water-tight for a long period when fairly\\\\r\\\\nused. (Mem.--Oil and grease are as fatal to macintosh as they are to\\\\r\\\\niron rust.) But the taste that these vessels impart to their contents is\\\\r\\\\nabominable, not only at first but for a very long time; in two-thirds of\\\\r\\\\nthem it is never to be got rid of. Never believe shopkeepers in an\\\\r\\\\nindia-rubber shop, in their assurances to the contrary; they are\\\\r\\\\nincompetent to judge aright, for their senses seem vitiated by the air\\\\r\\\\nthey live in. The best shape for a small macintosh water-vessel has yet\\\\r\\\\nto be determined. Several alpine men use them; and their most recent\\\\r\\\\npatterns may probably best be seen at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter,\\\\r\\\\nOxford Street. A flask of dressed hide (pig, goat, or dog) with a wooden\\\\r\\\\nnozzle, and a wooden plug to fit into it, is very good. Canvas bags,\\\\r\\\\nsmeared with grease on the outside, will become nearly waterproof after a\\\\r\\\\nshort soaking. A strong glass flask may be made out of a soda-water\\\\r\\\\nbottle; it should have raw hide shrunk upon it to preserve it from sharp\\\\r\\\\ntaps Likely to make a crack. Calabashes and other gourds, cocoa-nuts and\\\\r\\\\nostrich eggs, are all of them excellent for flasks. The Bushmen of South\\\\r\\\\nAfrica make great use of ostrich shells as water-vessels. They have\\\\r\\\\nstations at many places in the desert, where they bury these shells\\\\r\\\\nfilled with water, corked with grass, and occasionally waxed over. They\\\\r\\\\nthus go without hesitation over wide tracts, for their sense of locality\\\\r\\\\nis so strong that they never fear to forget the spot in which they have\\\\r\\\\ndug their hiding-place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen a Dutchman or a Namaqua wants to carry a load of ostrich eggs to or\\\\r\\\\nfrom the watering-place, or when he robs a nest, he takes off his\\\\r\\\\ntrousers, ties up the ankles, puts the eggs in the legs, and carries off\\\\r\\\\nhis load slung round his neck. Nay, I have seen a half-civilised\\\\r\\\\nHottentot carry water in his leather breeches, ties up and slung in the\\\\r\\\\nway I have just described, but without the intervention of ostrich eggs;\\\\r\\\\nthe water squired through the seams, but plenty remained after he had\\\\r\\\\ncarried it to its destination, which was a couple of miles from the\\\\r\\\\nwatering-place. In an emergency, water-flasks can be improvised from the\\\\r\\\\nraw or dry skins of animals, which should be greased down the back; or\\\\r\\\\nfrom the paunch, the heart-bag (pericardium), the intestines, or the\\\\r\\\\nbladder. These should have a wooden skewer runing and out along one side\\\\r\\\\nof their mouths, by which they can be carried, and a lashing under the\\\\r\\\\nskewer to make all tight (fig. below).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of bag with skewer and bag being carried].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Bushmen do this. The water oozes through the membrane, and by its\\\\r\\\\nevaporation the contents are kept very cool. Another plan is, after\\\\r\\\\nhaving tied a length of intestine at both ends, to roll it up in a\\\\r\\\\nhandkerchief and wear it as a belt round the waist. The fault of these\\\\r\\\\nmembranous bags, besides their disgusting character and want of strength\\\\r\\\\nis, that they become putrid after a few days' use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVessels for Cooling Water may be made that shall also act efficiently as\\\\r\\\\nflasks. Porous earthen jars are too brittle for long use, and their pores\\\\r\\\\nchoke up if slimy water be put inside them. But the Arabs use a porous\\\\r\\\\nleather flask, called a Zemsemiya, which is hung on the shady side of the\\\\r\\\\ncamel, and by evaporation keeps the water deliciously cool: it is a\\\\r\\\\nrather wasteful way of carrying water. Canvas bags are equally effective.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOpen Buckets, for carrying water for short distances, or for storing it\\\\r\\\\nin camp, may be made of the bark of a tree, either taken off in an entire\\\\r\\\\ncylinder, and having a bottom fitted on, or else of a knot or excrescence\\\\r\\\\nthat has been cut off the outside of a tree, and its woody interior\\\\r\\\\nscooped out; or of birth bark sewed or pegged at the corners, and having\\\\r\\\\nits seams coated with the gum or resin of the pine-tree. Baskets with\\\\r\\\\noiled cloth inside, make efficient water-vessels; they are in use in\\\\r\\\\nFrance as firemen's buckets. Water-tight pots are made on the Snake river\\\\r\\\\nby winding long touch roots in a spiral manner, and lashing the coils to\\\\r\\\\none another, just as is done in making a beehive. Earthenware jars are\\\\r\\\\nexcellent, when they can be obtained.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo prevent Splashing.--When carrying water in buckets, put a wreath of\\\\r\\\\ngrass, or something else that will float, on the water, to prevent it\\\\r\\\\nfrom splashing; and also make a hoop, inside which the porter may walk,\\\\r\\\\nwhile his laden hands rest on its rim: the hoop keeps his hands wide from\\\\r\\\\nhis body, and prevents the buckets from knocking against his legs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMending Leather Water-vessels.--If a water-vessel becomes leaky, the\\\\r\\\\nhole should be caulked by stuffing a rag, a wedge of wood, a tuft of\\\\r\\\\ngrass, or anything else into it, as shown in the upper figure and also in\\\\r\\\\nthe left side of the lower one (p. 230), and then greasing or waxing it\\\\r\\\\nover. A larger rent must be Seized upon, the lips of the wound pinched\\\\r\\\\nup, a thorn or other spike run through the lips, and lastly a piece of\\\\r\\\\ntwine lashed firmly round, underneath the thorn; the thorn keeps the\\\\r\\\\nstring from slipping off (See the right-hand corner of the lower figure.)\\\\r\\\\nWhen there is an opportunity, the bag must be patched, as is also shown\\\\r\\\\nin the lower figure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of parts of two bags as referred to in text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRepairing a battered Metal Flask.--Fill it with dry seed, such as peas\\\\r\\\\nor mustard-seed; then pour in water and put the stopper into it. After a\\\\r\\\\nperiod varying from 1 to 3 or 4 hours, according to the nature of the\\\\r\\\\nseeds, they will begin to swell and to force the sides of the flask\\\\r\\\\noutwards into their original shape. The swelling proceeds rather rapidly\\\\r\\\\nafter it has once commenced, so the operation requires watching, lest it\\\\r\\\\nshould be overdone and the flask should burst.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCorks and Stoppers.--Thrust a cork tightly into the mouth of the flask,\\\\r\\\\ncut a hole through the cork and plug the hole, which will henceforth form\\\\r\\\\nthe outlet of the flask--with a stopper of wood, bone, or other hard\\\\r\\\\nsubstance. Thread, wound round a slightly conical plug that has been\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently notched to retain it in its place, makes it nearly\\\\r\\\\nwater-tight as a stopper. It is of less importance that the stopper\\\\r\\\\nshould fit closely, if the flask be so slung that its mouth shall be\\\\r\\\\nalways uppermost: a very imperfect cork will then be sufficient to check\\\\r\\\\nevaporation and splashing, and to prevent the loss of more than a few\\\\r\\\\ndrops from occasional upsets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrinking, when riding or walking.--It is an awkward matter to drink when\\\\r\\\\njolting on wheels, on horseback, or on foot. I adopted the plan of\\\\r\\\\ncarrying a piece of small india-rubber tubing 6 or 8 inches long, and\\\\r\\\\nwhen I wished to drink, I removed the stopper and inserted the tube, just\\\\r\\\\nas an insect might let down its proboscis, and sucked the contents. Sir\\\\r\\\\nS. Baker says of the people of Unyoro, \\\\\\\"During a journey, a pretty,\\\\r\\\\nbottle-shaped, long-necked gourd is carried with a store of\\\\r\\\\nplantain-cider; the mouth of the bottle is stopped with a bundle of the\\\\r\\\\nwhite rush shreds, through which a reed is inserted that reaches to the\\\\r\\\\nbottom: thus the drink can be sucked up during the march, without the\\\\r\\\\nnecessity of halting; nor is it possible to spill it by the movement of\\\\r\\\\nwalking.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKegs and Tanks.--Keys for Pack-saddles.--Small barrels, flattened\\\\r\\\\nequally on both sides, so that their tops and bottoms shall be of an oval\\\\r\\\\nand not a circular shape, are the most convenient vessels,\\\\r\\\\nnotwithstanding their weight, for carrying water on pack-saddles across a\\\\r\\\\nbroken country. They are exceedingly strong, and require no particular\\\\r\\\\nattention, while bags of leather or macintosh suffer from thorns, and\\\\r\\\\nnatives secretly prick them during the march, that they may suck a\\\\r\\\\ndraught of water. These kegs should not exceed 22 inches in length, 10 in\\\\r\\\\nextreme breadth, and 7 in extreme width; a cask of these measurements\\\\r\\\\nwould hold about 40 lbs. weight of water, and its own weight might be 15\\\\r\\\\nlbs. As the water is expended, it is easy to replace the diminished\\\\r\\\\nweight by putting on a bag from one of the other packs. Before starting\\\\r\\\\naway into the bush, these kegs should be satisfactorily fitted and\\\\r\\\\nadjusted to the pack-saddle that is intended to carry them, in such a way\\\\r\\\\nthat they may be packed on to it with the least possible trouble. A\\\\r\\\\ncouple of leather or iron loops Fixed to each keg, and made to catch on\\\\r\\\\nto the hooks which are let flush into the sides of the pack-saddle, will\\\\r\\\\neffect this.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe sketch represents a section of the pack-saddle, at the place where\\\\r\\\\none of the hooks is situated on either side, but the front of the kegs\\\\r\\\\nthemselves, and not their section, is given. Above and between the kegs\\\\r\\\\nlies a bag, and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes\\\\r\\\\nover the whole burden, and is buckled to a similar short strap on the\\\\r\\\\nother side. It is of importance that the bung-hole should be placed even\\\\r\\\\nnearer to the rim than where it is drawn, for it is necessary that it\\\\r\\\\nshould be convenient to pour out of and to pour into, and that it should\\\\r\\\\nbe placed on the highest part of the keg, both when on the beast's back\\\\r\\\\nand also when it stands on the ground, lest water should leak and be\\\\r\\\\nlost. According to the above plan, when water is ladled into it, the rim\\\\r\\\\nkeeps it from spilling; and in pouring out water, the run acts as a\\\\r\\\\nspout. In making the bung-hole, a metal plate, with a screw-hole in it,\\\\r\\\\nis firmly fixed in the face of the cask; into this a wooden stopper,\\\\r\\\\nbound with iron, is made to screw (natives would probably steal a metal\\\\r\\\\none). The stopper has a small head and a deeply-cut neck, by which it is\\\\r\\\\ntied to the cask, and its body has a large hole bored in it, which admits\\\\r\\\\nof a stick being put through, to prize it round, if it should become\\\\r\\\\njammed. A spigot, to screw into the bung-hole on arriving at camp, might\\\\r\\\\nbe really useful; but if used, a gimlet-hole must be bored in the cask to\\\\r\\\\nact as an air-vent. A large tundish is very convenient, and a spare plug\\\\r\\\\nmight be taken; but a traveller, with a little painstaking, could soon\\\\r\\\\ncut a plug with his own knife, sufficiently well made to allow of its\\\\r\\\\nbeing Firmly screwed in, and of retaining the water, if it had a bit of\\\\r\\\\nrag wrapped round it. A piece of rag rolled tightly, will suffice to plug\\\\r\\\\na hole.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSiphons.--A flexible tube of some kind, whether of india-rubber,\\\\r\\\\ngutta-percha, or, still better, of macintosh, strained over rings, would\\\\r\\\\nbe very valuable as a siphon: both for filling large kegs out of buckets\\\\r\\\\nand for emptying them again. Vulcanised india-rubber becomes rotten after\\\\r\\\\nshort use, and gutta-percha will stand no extremes of temperature.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTanks for Wagons.--There still remain many large districts in Asia,\\\\r\\\\nAfrica, and Australia which may be explored in wagons, but, so far as I\\\\r\\\\nam aware, no particular pattern of a water-tank, suitable for carriage on\\\\r\\\\nwheels, has yet been adopted by travellers. I believe kegs are generally\\\\r\\\\nused, but they are far too heavy for the requirements of a wagon.\\\\r\\\\nProbably the tins used for sending milk by cart and railway to towns,\\\\r\\\\nwould be very serviceable for carrying water on expeditions. They are\\\\r\\\\ninvariably made of the same shape, and only of few different sizes.\\\\r\\\\nTherefore experience must have shown that their pattern is better than\\\\r\\\\nany other yet devised. Their mouths can be padlocked, which is an\\\\r\\\\nimportant matter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMacintosh Bags.--I would also recommend a trial of square bags of strong\\\\r\\\\nmacintosh--say 18 inches deep and 10 inches square, in which case they\\\\r\\\\nwould hold 60 lbs. of water--fitting into square compartments, in large\\\\r\\\\npanniers, like those in a bottle-basket. I have made some experiments\\\\r\\\\nupon this arrangement. The basket-work gives protection against blows and\\\\r\\\\nthe jolting together of packages, and it yields without harm to a strain,\\\\r\\\\nand the bags yield also. Moreover, water is less churned in half-empty\\\\r\\\\nbags than in half-empty barrels. No unusual strength of materials would\\\\r\\\\nbe required in making these bags: their mouths should be funnel-shaped,\\\\r\\\\nand corked at the neck of the funnel. The funnels should be wide at their\\\\r\\\\nmouths, for convenience in filling them; and a string to secure the cork\\\\r\\\\nshould be tied round the neck of the funnel. The bags should have loops\\\\r\\\\non their sides, through which a strap, passing underneath, might run, in\\\\r\\\\norder to Give a good hold for lifting them up. They could easily be\\\\r\\\\nfilled as they lay in their compartments, and would only require to be\\\\r\\\\nlifted out in order to empty them; there is, therefore, no objection to\\\\r\\\\ntheir holding as much as 60 lbs. weight of water. An india-rubber tube as\\\\r\\\\na siphon, and with a common spigot at the end of it, would be\\\\r\\\\nparticularly useful. A pannier not much exceeding 30 inches long, by 20\\\\r\\\\nbroad, and 18 deep, would hold six of these bags, or 360 lbs. weight of\\\\r\\\\nwater in all; and two such panniers would be ample for exploring\\\\r\\\\npurposes. I had a pannier and two bags made for a trial, which were quite\\\\r\\\\nsatisfactory, and I found that the weight of the panniers and bags\\\\r\\\\ntogether was at the rate of 6 lbs. for each compartment; therefore the\\\\r\\\\nweight of these water-vessels is not more than 10 per cent. Of that of\\\\r\\\\nthe water which they carry. It might be well to vary the contents of some\\\\r\\\\nof the compartments; putting, for instance, two or even three small bags\\\\r\\\\ninto one, and tin cases into a few of the others, instead of the large\\\\r\\\\nbags. These panniers, with the bags inflated, and connected together by a\\\\r\\\\nstage, would form an excellent and powerful raft. If secured within a\\\\r\\\\nwagon about to cross a deep river, they would have enough power, in all\\\\r\\\\nordinary cases, to cause it to float and not to sink to the bottom. I\\\\r\\\\ntrust some explorer will try this plan. I may add that the macintosh\\\\r\\\\nwater-bags cost me about 1 pound each.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRaw Hide Bags/--Captain Sturt, when he explored in Australia, took a tank\\\\r\\\\nin his cart, which burst, and besides that, he carried casks of water. By\\\\r\\\\nthese he was enabled to face a desert country with a degree of success to\\\\r\\\\nwhich no traveller before had ever attained. For instance, when returning\\\\r\\\\nhomewards, the water was found to be drying up on all sides of him. He\\\\r\\\\nwas encamped by a pool where he was safe, whence the next stage was 118\\\\r\\\\nmiles, or 4 days' journey, but it was a matter of considerable doubt\\\\r\\\\nwhether there remained any water at the end of the stage. It was\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely necessary to reconnoitre, and in order to do so, he had first\\\\r\\\\nto provide the messenger with the means of returning, should the\\\\r\\\\nwatering-place be found dry. He killed a bullock, skinned it, and filling\\\\r\\\\nthe skin with water (which held 150 gallons), Sent it by an ex-dray 30\\\\r\\\\nmiles, with orders to bury it and to return. Shortly after he despatched\\\\r\\\\na light one-horse cart, carrying 36 gallons of water; the horse and man\\\\r\\\\nwere to drink at the hide, and then to go on. Thus they had 36 gallons to\\\\r\\\\nsupply them for a journey of 176 miles, or 6 days, at 30 miles a day at\\\\r\\\\nthe close of which they would return to the ox-hide--sleeping, in fact,\\\\r\\\\n5 nights on 36 gallons of water. This a hardy, well-driven horse could\\\\r\\\\ndo, even in the hottest climate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo raise Water from Wells for Cattle.--By hand.--Let one man stand in\\\\r\\\\nthe water, or just above it; another 5 feet higher; and again another\\\\r\\\\nhigher still, if the depth of the well requires it. Then let the\\\\r\\\\nlowermost man dip a bucket in the water, and pass it from hand to hand\\\\r\\\\nupwards; the top man pours the water into a trough, out of which the\\\\r\\\\ncattle drink. This trough may be simply a ditch scratched in the ground;\\\\r\\\\na piece of canvas should be thrown over it, if the soil be sandy, to keep\\\\r\\\\nthe water from being lost before the cattle have time to drink it. Thus\\\\r\\\\nEyre speaks of watering his horse, out of his black servant's duck frock.\\\\r\\\\nLight gutta-percha buckets are very useful in temperate climates; and so\\\\r\\\\nare baskets, with oilcloth inside them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe drove of cattle should be brought up to 60 yards from the\\\\r\\\\nwatering-place; then three or four should be driven out--they will run\\\\r\\\\nat once to the water. After they have drunk, drive them to one side, and\\\\r\\\\nlet another three or four take their place, and so on; keeping the two\\\\r\\\\ndroves quite distinct--those that have drunk, and those that are waiting\\\\r\\\\nto drink. They will drink at the rate of one per minute; sheep and goats\\\\r\\\\ndrink very much faster. Never let the cattle go in a rush to the well,\\\\r\\\\nelse they will stamp it in, most of them get no water, and they will all\\\\r\\\\ndo a great deal of damage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy horse power.--It does not fall within the scope of this book to\\\\r\\\\ndescribe water-wheels worked by cattle, or elaborate mechanism of any\\\\r\\\\nkind; I therefore only mention under this head, that the Tartars\\\\r\\\\nsometimes draw water from their wells, of 150 feet deep and upwards, by a\\\\r\\\\nrider harnessing the bucket-rope to his horse, and galloping him off to a\\\\r\\\\nmark that tells the proper distance. Their ropes are of twisted hair, and\\\\r\\\\nare made to run over a smoothed stone, or a log of wood.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketches of pole and bucket and pump as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA pole and bucket is a very convenient way of raising water from 4 to 12\\\\r\\\\nfeet. The bucket may be made of canvas, basket-work, leather, wood, or\\\\r\\\\nalmost any other material; leakage, though considerable, is of little\\\\r\\\\nconsequence, because the action of the apparatus is so quick, that there\\\\r\\\\nis not time for much water to be lost. This contrivance is used over\\\\r\\\\nalmost the whole globe--less in England than elsewhere; it is very\\\\r\\\\ncommon where long poles can easily be obtained, as in fir forests.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPump.--An excellent and very simple pump is used by the Arabs in\\\\r\\\\nAlgeria. A piece of leather or waxed canvas, is stretched round one or\\\\r\\\\nmore hoops; it forms a hollow cylinder, that admits of being shut flat\\\\r\\\\nlike an accordion. The top and bottom of the cylinder are secured round\\\\r\\\\nthe edges of two discs of wood. Holes are bored in these discs and\\\\r\\\\nleather valves are fitted to them. The lower disc is nailed to the bottom\\\\r\\\\nof a tub; the hole in it corresponds with the feed-pipe, and the valve\\\\r\\\\nthat covers the hole opens upwards. The upper disc Is attached to the\\\\r\\\\npump handle; the valves that cover the holes in this disc, open upwards\\\\r\\\\nalso. When the leather-pump barrel is pressed flat, water flows through\\\\r\\\\nthe upper valves into the barrel around it; when it is pulled out, water\\\\r\\\\nis sucked up through the feed-pipe, and an equal quantity is displaced\\\\r\\\\nfrom the barrel. This flows out into the trough. A bag would do as well\\\\r\\\\nas a tub, to hold the water which surrounds the pump-barrel; but, without\\\\r\\\\nthe water which it is the object of either the one or the other to\\\\r\\\\ncontain, the pump-barrel must be air-proof as well as water-proof. The\\\\r\\\\naction of this pump is marvellously perfect. It attracted much attention\\\\r\\\\nin the French Exhibition of 1855.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGUNS AND RIFLES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--Breech-loaders.--At the present time when the merits\\\\r\\\\nof different kinds of breech-loader are so hotly discussed, when all that\\\\r\\\\nhave yet been invented have some faults, and every month brings to light\\\\r\\\\nsome new invention, it would be foolish in me to write anything about\\\\r\\\\nthem; it would be obsolete before the great majority of my readers should\\\\r\\\\nhave seen this book. Therefore omitting breech-loaders altogether from\\\\r\\\\nthe present edition, I will confine myself to repeating what I have said\\\\r\\\\nbefore upon muzzle-loaders, with additions and alterations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSize of Gun.--American bushrangers advocate a long heavy pea-rifle, on\\\\r\\\\nthe plea of its accurate shooting, and the enormous saving in weight of\\\\r\\\\nammunition when bullets of a small size are used. The objections to\\\\r\\\\nsmall-bored rifles are, insufficiency against large game (even with\\\\r\\\\nconical bullets), and a tendency to become foul after a few shots. A\\\\r\\\\nshort light rifle, whether with a large or a small bore, is, I believe,\\\\r\\\\nutterly worthless. In the hands of a man trembling with running and with\\\\r\\\\nexhaustion, it shakes like a wand: the shorter the rifle, the more\\\\r\\\\nquickly does it oscillate, and of course, in the same proportion, is it\\\\r\\\\ndifficult to catch the exact moment when the sights cover the object.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor the larger kinds of game, such as elephants and buffaloes,\\\\r\\\\nexperienced sportsmen mostly prefer guns of immense Bore, carrying round\\\\r\\\\nbullets that weigh a quarter of a pound. The recoil is tremendous, and\\\\r\\\\nwould injure the shoulder if the sportsman did not use a pad against\\\\r\\\\nwhich he rests the gun. The guns must be strong, because very large\\\\r\\\\ncharges of powder are invariably used where great power of penetration is\\\\r\\\\nrequired. African sportsmen found this out experimentally long before the\\\\r\\\\nidea occurred to artillerists.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSights.--The hind sight should be far from the eye, even though it be\\\\r\\\\nplaced half-way down the barrel: else it becomes out of focus and\\\\r\\\\nindistinct, when the eye is firmly set on the object aimed at; this\\\\r\\\\ndrawback is never compensated by the advantage of having the front and\\\\r\\\\nhind sights far asunder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRamrod.--The guns of servants and indeed those of their masters, should\\\\r\\\\nhave thin soft-iron ramrods; the elasticity of these when slightly bent,\\\\r\\\\nwill retain them in the ramrod-tubes; both ends of the ramrod must be\\\\r\\\\nforged broad.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScrew to secure the Cock.--In common guns, this screw is very liable to\\\\r\\\\nget loose, fall out and be lost; it is therefore desirable to have one or\\\\r\\\\nmore spare screws.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWater-proof Cover should not be forgotten.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRust, to prevent.--Paraffine and mercurial ointment are perhaps the two\\\\r\\\\nbest things to keep rust off iron, in sea voyages or in boat-shooting.\\\\r\\\\nBefore embarking for a voyage, it is convenient to enclose the guns in a\\\\r\\\\nleaden case, which, on arrival, can be melted up into bullets. It is\\\\r\\\\nremarkable how much better dirty guns withstand rust than clean ones.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOlive oil, to purify.--Put a piece of lead in the glass bottle that\\\\r\\\\ncontains the oil, and expose to the sun; a quantity of cloudy matter will\\\\r\\\\nseparate after a few days, then the refined oil may be decanted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe small of the stock is the weakest part of a gun: it is constantly\\\\r\\\\nbroken by falls in travel. Sir Samuel Baker justly recommends that \\\\\\\"all\\\\r\\\\nguns made for sport in wild countries and rough riding, should have steel\\\\r\\\\ninstead of iron from the Breech-socket, extending far back to within six\\\\r\\\\ninches of the shoulder plate; the trigger-guard should likewise be steel,\\\\r\\\\nand should be carried back to an equal distance with the above rib; the\\\\r\\\\nsteel should be of extra thickness, and screwed through to the upper\\\\r\\\\npiece; thus the two being connected by screws above and below, no fall\\\\r\\\\ncould break the stock.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInjuries to Guns, to repair.--Ramrod tubes often break off, and it is a\\\\r\\\\nvery troublesome accident when they do so. I know of no contrivance to\\\\r\\\\nfasten them on again, except by using soft solder, the application of\\\\r\\\\nwhich will not in the least hurt the gun: ashes, at a dull red heat, must\\\\r\\\\nbe heaped over the barrel to warm it sufficiently, before applying the\\\\r\\\\nsolder. If the ramrod tubes have been lost, others made of tin may\\\\r\\\\nreplace them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Sight of a Gun, if it falls out and is lost, can easily be replaced\\\\r\\\\nby a substitute. A groove must be cut with a file across the substance of\\\\r\\\\nthe barrel, if the gun be a single one, or across the midrib, if\\\\r\\\\ndouble-barrelled; into this a piece of iron, ivory, bone, horn, or hard\\\\r\\\\nwood, with a projection carved in the middle for the sight, must be\\\\r\\\\npushed, then the metal on either side must be battered down over it, with\\\\r\\\\na hammer or stone, to keep it firm.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA broken Stock, however much it may be smashed, can be well mended by raw\\\\r\\\\nhide (see \\\\\\\"Hides\\\\\\\"). Blacksmith's work and carpentering are seldom\\\\r\\\\nsufficient for the purpose. It is within the power of a rough workman to\\\\r\\\\nmake a gun-stock, but it is a work of great labour.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA Ramrod may be replaced by cutting a stick from a tree, straightening it\\\\r\\\\nin the fire, and then seasoning it. (See \\\\\\\"Green Wood.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGuns to hang up, to carry, and to clean.--Hanging Guns to a Wall.--Fix\\\\r\\\\na loop of leather for the muzzle, and a strap and buckle for the stock,\\\\r\\\\nwith a piece of sheepskin or canvas nailed so as to hang over it, as in\\\\r\\\\nfig. 1. A more complete way is to sew a long pocket with a flap to it,\\\\r\\\\nwhich is tied up on to a stick or bar, as in fig. 2: the gun has simply\\\\r\\\\nto be Lifted out and in. The pocket must be made baggy at the part which\\\\r\\\\ncorresponds to the cocks of the gun.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 As described in text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarrying Guns on a Journey.--\\\\\\\"Look at the gun, but never let the gun\\\\r\\\\nlook at you, or at your companions,\\\\\\\" is a golden rule; for among the\\\\r\\\\nchances of death to which a traveller is exposed, that of being shot by\\\\r\\\\nan attendant's gun going off accidentally, ranks high. Servants should\\\\r\\\\ncarry their guns with the cock down on a piece of rag, that covers the\\\\r\\\\ncap: take it all in all, it is the best plan for them. A sportsman will\\\\r\\\\nfind great convenience in having a third nick cut in the tumbler of his\\\\r\\\\nlock, so as to give an additional low half-cock, at which the cock just\\\\r\\\\nclears the nipple; it will prevent the cap from falling off or receiving\\\\r\\\\na blow. I have long used this plan, and find no objections to it: many\\\\r\\\\npistols are furnished with this contrivance. Careless gun-makers\\\\r\\\\nsometimes make this catch so low, that when the cock is lifted a little\\\\r\\\\nback from it, and let go, it strikes the cap by reason of the elasticity\\\\r\\\\nof its metal, and lets off the gun: the traveller should beware of this\\\\r\\\\nfault of workmanship.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of gun as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs this book may fall into the hands of persons ignorant of the danger of\\\\r\\\\ncarrying a gun with the cock down on the nipple (to which cause I find\\\\r\\\\nthat three-fourths of gun accidents are owing, having once kept a list of\\\\r\\\\nthose that were reported in the newspapers), I will remark that when the\\\\r\\\\ncock is down, a heavy blow on its back, nay, even the jar caused by the\\\\r\\\\ngun falling on the ground, will cause the cap to explode. Again if the\\\\r\\\\ncock catch against the dress, or against A twig, it is liable to be\\\\r\\\\nlifted, when, on being released, it will snap down upon the cap. When a\\\\r\\\\ngun is at half-cock, the first of these accidents obviously cannot occur;\\\\r\\\\nand, as to the second, if the cock be pulled back and let drop, it falls,\\\\r\\\\nnot down upon the cap, but to half-cock again, except only in the case\\\\r\\\\nwhere the trigger is also pressed back. The objections to carrying a gun\\\\r\\\\nat half-cock are, that careless people occasionally leave it on full-cock\\\\r\\\\nwithout perceiving the difference, and that there is a probability of\\\\r\\\\nweakening the main-spring, if day after day it be kept on the strain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarrying Guns when Stalking Game.--In creeping after game, the gun is\\\\r\\\\nalways troublesome; there is no better plan than pushing it as far as the\\\\r\\\\narm can reach, then creeping up to it, and again pushing it forwards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarrying Guns on Horseback.--Allow me very strongly to recommend a trial\\\\r\\\\nof the following plan, even for a shooting-pony in Scotland. It is the\\\\r\\\\ninvention of the Namaquas. I and all my party in South Africa used it for\\\\r\\\\na year and a half, and many persons have adopted the plan in England\\\\r\\\\nsince I first published a description of it. Sew a bag of canvas,\\\\r\\\\nleather, or hide, of such a size as to admit the butt of the gun pretty\\\\r\\\\nfreely. The straps that support the bag, buckle through a ring in the\\\\r\\\\npommel; the thongs by which the slope of the bag is adjusted, are\\\\r\\\\nfastened round the girth, below. The exact adjustments may not be hit\\\\r\\\\nupon, by an unpractised person, for some time; but, when they are once\\\\r\\\\nascertained, the thongs need never be shifted. The gun is perfectly safe:\\\\r\\\\nit never comes below the armpit, even in taking a crop leap: it is pulled\\\\r\\\\nout in an instant by bringing the elbow forwards in front of the gun and\\\\r\\\\nthen backwards, pressing it against the side; by this manner, the gun is\\\\r\\\\nthrown to the outside of the arm: then, lowering the hand, catch the gun\\\\r\\\\nas near the trigger-guard as you can, and lift it out of the bag: (it is\\\\r\\\\na bungling way to take out the gun whilst its barrel lies between the arm\\\\r\\\\nand the body). Any sized gun can be carried in this fashion, and it\\\\r\\\\noffers no obstacle to mounting or dismounting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI hear that some sportsmen, who were probably unacquainted with this\\\\r\\\\nmethod, have used a bag or pocket of stiff Leather attached to the side\\\\r\\\\nof the saddle, just behind the right leg; into this, when tired of\\\\r\\\\ncarrying the gun, they push the butt. It is said to lie there securely\\\\r\\\\nand to give no trouble, the barrel passes forwards under the right arm,\\\\r\\\\nand the muzzle is in front of the rider.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Drawing of horse, rider and gun as described above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe French dragoons carry a gun in a way that is convenient for military\\\\r\\\\npurposes, because it does not interfere with the immense housings that\\\\r\\\\ncavalry soldiers require; but it is not so handy, it does not lie so\\\\r\\\\nfreely as the above, nor is it as well suited to a traveller or a\\\\r\\\\nsportsman. The gun is placed butt downwards, as in the Namaqua method,\\\\r\\\\nand leans backwards in the same way; but the under side of the gun,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of being backwards, or towards the horse's tail, Is towards his\\\\r\\\\nhead. The butt lies in a shallow bucket, secured by two straps fixed to\\\\r\\\\nthe front of the saddle; another strap, leading from the pommel, and\\\\r\\\\npassing over the right thigh of the rider, is hitched round the barrel of\\\\r\\\\nthe gun, and has to be unbuckled and cast off when the gun is taken out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll ways of carrying the gun with its muzzle downwards, are very\\\\r\\\\nobjectionable; since the jolting tends to dislodge the charge; if it be\\\\r\\\\nconsiderably dislodged, the gun will probably burst, on being fired.\\\\r\\\\nAlso, a very little shaking, when the muzzle is downwards, will shake the\\\\r\\\\npowder out of the nipple, and therefore, a gun, so carried, will\\\\r\\\\nconstantly miss fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt Night, to dispose of Guns.--A gun is a very awkward thing to dispose\\\\r\\\\nof at night. It has occurred more than once that a native servant has\\\\r\\\\ncrept up, drawn away the gun of his sleeping master, and shot him dead.\\\\r\\\\nThe following appears to me an excellent plan:--\\\\\\\"When getting sleepy, you\\\\r\\\\nreturn your rifle between your legs, roll over, and go to sleep. Some\\\\r\\\\npeople may think this is a queer place for a rifle; but, on the contrary,\\\\r\\\\nit is the position of all others where utility and comfort are most\\\\r\\\\ncombined.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of man and gun as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe butt rests on the arm, and serves as a pillow for the head; the\\\\r\\\\nmuzzle points between the knees, and the arms encircle the lock and\\\\r\\\\nbreech, so that you have a smooth pillow, and are always prepared to\\\\r\\\\nstart Up armed at a moment's notice.\\\\\\\" (Parkyns' 'Abyssinia.') The longer\\\\r\\\\nthe gun, the more secure is the sleeper from accident. The sketch is not\\\\r\\\\nquite accurate, for, in practice, the weight of the gun is never allowed\\\\r\\\\nto rest so entirely on the arm, as it is here represented: if it did so,\\\\r\\\\nthe arm would soon be numbed. The gun-stock may be a little bolstered up\\\\r\\\\nif desired, to avoid any troublesome pressure on the arm.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCleaning Guns.--A bit of rag does as well as tow, and can be used over\\\\r\\\\nand over again. A top furnished with a sponge, to screw to the cleaning\\\\r\\\\nrod, is convenient. \\\\\\\"A leaded barrel must be cleaned with fine sand.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n(Hawker.) Quicksilver, if it be at hand, will dissolve out the lead at\\\\r\\\\nonce.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGUN-FITTINGS AND AMMUNITION.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPowder-flask.--The flask that is carried in the pocket may be small, if\\\\r\\\\nroomy; a large one, in reserve, being kept in a bag, at the front of the\\\\r\\\\nsaddle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo reduce bulges in a metal powder-flask, fill it up with Indian corn, or\\\\r\\\\ndry peas, of any other sort of hard grain; then pour water into it, and\\\\r\\\\nscrew down the lid tightly. The grain will swell, at first slowly and\\\\r\\\\nthen very rapidly, and the flask will resume its former dimensions, or\\\\r\\\\nburst if it is not watched. Peas do not begin to swell for a couple of\\\\r\\\\nhours or more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPowder-horn, to make.--Saw off the required length from an ox's horn,\\\\r\\\\nflatten it somewhat by heat (see \\\\\\\"Horn\\\\\\\"), fit a wooden bottom into it,\\\\r\\\\ncaulk it well, and sew raw hide round the edge to keep all tight. The\\\\r\\\\nmouth must be secured by a plug, which may be hollowed to make a charger.\\\\r\\\\nPieces of cane of large diameter, and old gunpowder canisters, sewn up in\\\\r\\\\nhide, make useful powder-flasks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPercussion Caps.--Caps may be carried very conveniently by means of a\\\\r\\\\nring, with two dozen nipple-shaped beads, made of some metal, strung upon\\\\r\\\\nit; each bead being intended to be covered by a percussion-cap. The beads\\\\r\\\\nare cleft down the middle, which gives them a slight springiness, that\\\\r\\\\nmore effectually secures the caps that are placed upon them: the ring is\\\\r\\\\ntied by a thong to the belt or button-hole. It is very Difficult, without\\\\r\\\\nthis contrivance, to keep caps free from sand, crumbs, and dirt, yet\\\\r\\\\nalways at hand when required. I can confidently recommend it, though as\\\\r\\\\nit is old-fashioned and not well suited for sportsmen in England, it is\\\\r\\\\nrarely to be met with. Spring cap holders are, I am sure, too delicate\\\\r\\\\nfor rough travel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo protect Caps from the Rain.--Before stalking, or watching at night in\\\\r\\\\nrainy weather, wax or grease the edge of the cap as it rests on the\\\\r\\\\nnipple: it will thus become proof against water and damp air. Some\\\\r\\\\npersons carry a piece of grease with them, when shooting in wet weather,\\\\r\\\\nand with it they smear the top of the nipple after each loading, before\\\\r\\\\nputting on the fresh cap. It is said that the grease does not prevent the\\\\r\\\\nfull action of the cap upon the powder. A sportsman has recommended to me\\\\r\\\\na couple of well-marked caps, into the heads of which small wads of cork\\\\r\\\\nhave been fitted; he uses them for loaded guns that are to be laid by for\\\\r\\\\nsome hours or days. A broad leaf wrapped loosely round the lock of a gun,\\\\r\\\\nwill protect it during a heavy shower.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitute for Caps.--When the revolution in Spain in 1854 began, \\\\\\\"there\\\\r\\\\nwas a great want of percussion caps; this the insurgents supplied by\\\\r\\\\ncutting off the heads of lucifer-matches and sticking them into the\\\\r\\\\nnipples. The plan was found to answer perfectly.\\\\\\\" (Times, July 31.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGun-pricker.--I am indebted for the following plan, both for clearing\\\\r\\\\nthe touchhole, and also for the rather awkward operation of pricking down\\\\r\\\\nfresh gunpowder into it, to an old sportsman in the Orkney Island of\\\\r\\\\nSanday. He takes a quill, and cuts off a broad ring from the large end of\\\\r\\\\nit; this is pushed over the small end of the quill, and lies securely\\\\r\\\\nthere. Next, he cuts a wooden plug to fit the quill; into the plug, the\\\\r\\\\npricker is fixed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of gun-pricker as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe whole affair goes safely in the pocket; the quill acting as a sheath\\\\r\\\\nto the sharp pricker. Now, when powder has to be pricked down the nipple,\\\\r\\\\nthe \\\\\\\"broad ring\\\\\\\" is slipped off the quill and put on the nipple, which it\\\\r\\\\nfits; powder is poured into it, and the required operation is easily\\\\r\\\\ncompleted. This little contrivance, which is so simple and Light, lasts\\\\r\\\\nfor months, and is perfectly effective. I have tried metal holders, but I\\\\r\\\\nmuch prefer the simple quill, on account of its elasticity and lightness.\\\\r\\\\nA little binding with waxed thread, may be put on, as shown in the\\\\r\\\\nsketch, to prevent the quill from splitting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWadding.--The bush affords few materials from which wadding can be made;\\\\r\\\\nsome birds' nests are excellent for the purpose. I am told that a dry\\\\r\\\\nhide will not serve as materials for wads.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlints.--According to Ure's Dictionary, the best stones to choose for\\\\r\\\\nmaking gun-flints are those that are not irregular in shape; they should\\\\r\\\\nhave, when broken, a greasy lustre, and be particularly smooth and\\\\r\\\\nfine-grained; the colour is of no importance, but it should be uniform in\\\\r\\\\nthe same lump; and the more transparent the stones the better. Gun-flints\\\\r\\\\nare made with a hammer, and a chisel of steel that is not hardened. The\\\\r\\\\nstone is chipped by the hammer alone into pieces of the required\\\\r\\\\nthickness, which are fashioned by being laid upon the fixed chisel, and\\\\r\\\\nhammered against it. It takes nearly a minute for a practised workman to\\\\r\\\\nmake one gun-flint.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGunpowder.--To carry Gunpowder.--Wrap it up in flannel or leather, not\\\\r\\\\nin paper, cotton, or linen; because these will catch fire, or smoulder\\\\r\\\\nlike tinder, whilst the former will do neither the one nor the other.\\\\r\\\\nGunpowder carried in a goat-skin bag, travels very safely. Mr. Gregory\\\\r\\\\ncarried his in the middle of his flour; each flour-bag (see p. 69),\\\\r\\\\nduring his North Australian expedition, had a tin of gunpowder in the\\\\r\\\\nmiddle of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo make Gunpowder.--It is difficult to make good gunpowder, but there is\\\\r\\\\nno skill required in making powder that will shoot and kill. Many of the\\\\r\\\\nnegroes of Africa, make it for themselves--burning the charcoal,\\\\r\\\\ngathering saltpetre from salt-pans, and buying the sulphur from trading\\\\r\\\\ncaravans: they grind the materials on a stone. In Chinese Tartary and\\\\r\\\\nThibet, every peasant manufactures it for himself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo make 8 lbs. of gunpowder, take 1 lb. of charcoal, 1 lb. of sulphur,\\\\r\\\\nand 6 lbs. of saltpetre. These proportions should be followed as\\\\r\\\\naccurately as possible. Each of the three materials must be pounded into\\\\r\\\\npowder separately, and then all mixed together most thoroughly. The\\\\r\\\\nmixture must have a little water added to it, Enough to make it bind into\\\\r\\\\na stiff paste (about one-tenth part, by measure, of water is sufficient;\\\\r\\\\nthat is to say, one cupful of water to ten cupfuls of the mixed powder).\\\\r\\\\nThe paste must be well kneaded together, with one stone on another, just\\\\r\\\\nas travellers usually make meal or grind coffee. It should then be\\\\r\\\\nwrapped up to a piece of canvas, or a skin, and pressed, with as heavy a\\\\r\\\\npressure as can be obtained, to condense it. Next, the cake is squeezed\\\\r\\\\nand worked against a sieve made of parchment, in which the holes have\\\\r\\\\nbeen burnt with a red-hot wire, and through which the cake is squeezed in\\\\r\\\\ngrains. These grains are now put into a box, which is well shaken about,\\\\r\\\\nand in this way the grains run each other smooth. The fine dust that is\\\\r\\\\nthen found mixed with the grains, must be winnowed away; lastly the\\\\r\\\\ngrains are dried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRecapitulation.--1. Pound the ingredients separately. @. Mix them. 3.\\\\r\\\\nAdd a little water, and knead the mass. 4. Press it. 5. Rub the mass\\\\r\\\\nthrough a sieve. 6. Shake up the grains in a box. 7. Get rid of the dust.\\\\r\\\\n8. Dry the grains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe ingredients should be used as pure as they can be obtained. For\\\\r\\\\nmaking a few charges of coarse powder, the sieve may be dispensed with:\\\\r\\\\nin this case, roll the dough into long pieces of the thickness of a pin;\\\\r\\\\nlay several of these side by side, and mince the whole into small grains;\\\\r\\\\ndust with powder, to prevent their sticking together: and then proceed as\\\\r\\\\nalready described.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo procure good Charcoal.--Light woods that give a porous charcoal, are\\\\r\\\\nthe best;--as poplar, alder, lime, horse-chestnut, willow, hazel-nut, and\\\\r\\\\nelder. It should be made with the greatest care, and used as soon as\\\\r\\\\npossible afterwards: it is the most important ingredient in gunpowder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSulphur.--The lumps must be melted over a gentle fire; the pot should\\\\r\\\\nthen be put in a heap of hot sand, to give the impurities time to settle,\\\\r\\\\nbefore it cools into a mass. When this has taken place, the bottom part\\\\r\\\\nmust be broken off and put aside as unfit for making gunpowder, and the\\\\r\\\\ntop part alone used. Flower of sulphur is quite pure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSaltpetre.--Dissolve the saltpetre that you wish to purify, in an equal\\\\r\\\\nmeasure of boiling water; a cupful of one to a cupful of the other.\\\\r\\\\nStrain this solution, and, letting it cool gradually, somewhat less than\\\\r\\\\nthree-fourths of the nitre will separate in regular crystals. Saltpetre\\\\r\\\\nexists in the ashes of many plants, of which tobacco is one; it is also\\\\r\\\\nfound copiously on the ground in many places, in saltpans, or simply as\\\\r\\\\nan effloresence. Rubbish, such as old mud huts, and mortar, generally\\\\r\\\\nabounds with it. (It is made by the action of the air on the potash\\\\r\\\\ncontained in the earths.) The taste, which is that of gunpowder, is the\\\\r\\\\nbest test of its presence. To extract it, pour hot water on the mass,\\\\r\\\\nthen evaporate and purify, as mentioned above.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRocket Composition consists of gunpowder 16 parts, by Weight; charcoal, 3\\\\r\\\\nparts. Or, in other words, of nitre, 16 parts; charcoal 7 parts; sulphur,\\\\r\\\\n4 parts. It must not be forgotten that when rockets are charged with the\\\\r\\\\ncomposition, a hollow tube must be left down their middle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlue Fire.--4 parts gunpowder meal; 2 parts nitre, 3 parts sulphur; 3\\\\r\\\\nparts zinc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBengal Fire.--7 parts nitre; 2 parts sulphur; 1 part antimony.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBullets--Sportsmen, fresh from England, and acknowledged as good shots\\\\r\\\\nat home, begin by shooting vilely with balls at large game. They must not\\\\r\\\\nbe discouraged at what is a general rule, but be satisfied that they will\\\\r\\\\nsoon do themselves justice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlloy.--Common bullets of lead, whether round or conical, are far\\\\r\\\\ninferior to those of hard alloy; for the latter penetrate much more\\\\r\\\\ndeeply, and break bones, instead of flattening against them. A mixture of\\\\r\\\\nvery little tin, or pewter (which is lead and tin), with lead, hardens\\\\r\\\\nit: we read of sportsmen melting up their spoons and dishes for this\\\\r\\\\npurpose. A little quicksilver has the same effect. Sir Samuel Baker, who\\\\r\\\\nis one of the most experienced sportsmen both in Ceylon and in Africa,\\\\r\\\\nlatterly used a mixture of nine-tenths lead and one-tenth quicksilver for\\\\r\\\\nhis bullets. He says, \\\\\\\"This is superior to all [other] mixtures for that\\\\r\\\\npurpose, as it combines hardness with extra weight; the lead must be\\\\r\\\\nmelted in a pot by itself to a red heat, and the proportion of\\\\r\\\\nquicksilver must be added a ladleful at a time, and stirred quickly with\\\\r\\\\na piece of iron just in sufficient quantity to make three or four\\\\r\\\\nbullets. If the quicksilver is subjected to red heat in the large\\\\r\\\\nleadpot, it will evaporate.\\\\\\\" Proper alloy, or spelter, had best be\\\\r\\\\nordered at a gun-maker's shop, and taken from England instead of lead:\\\\r\\\\ndifferent alloys of spelter vary considerably in their degree of\\\\r\\\\nhardness, and therefore more than one specimen should be tried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShape of Bullets.--Round iron bullets are worthless, except at very\\\\r\\\\nclose quarters, on account of the lightness of the metal: for the\\\\r\\\\nresistance of the air checks their force extremely. Whether elongated\\\\r\\\\niron bullets would succeed, remains to be Tried. Some savages--as, for\\\\r\\\\ninstance, those of Timor--when in want of bullets, use stones two or\\\\r\\\\nthree inches long. Some good sportsmen insist on the advantage, for\\\\r\\\\nshooting at very close quarters, of cleaving a conical bullet nearly down\\\\r\\\\nto its base, into four parts; these partly separate, and make a fearful\\\\r\\\\nwound. I suppose that the bullet leaves the gun with the same force as if\\\\r\\\\nit were entire; and that it traverses too short a distance for the\\\\r\\\\naltered form to tell seriously upon the speed: when it strikes, it acts\\\\r\\\\nlike chain-shot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBullets, to carry.--Bullets should be carried sewn up in their patches,\\\\r\\\\nfor the convenience of loading, and they should not fit too tight: a few\\\\r\\\\nmay be carried bare, for the sake of rapid loading.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRecovering Bullets.--When ammunition is scarce, make a practice of\\\\r\\\\nrecovering the bullets that may have been shot into a beast; if they are\\\\r\\\\nof spelter, they will be found to have been very little knocked out of\\\\r\\\\nshape, and may often be used again without recasting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShot and Slugs.--Travellers frequently omit to take enough shot, which\\\\r\\\\nis a great mistake, as birds are always to be found, while large game is\\\\r\\\\nuncertain: besides this, shot gives amusement; and ducks, quails, and\\\\r\\\\npartridges are much better eating than antelopes and buffaloes. It must\\\\r\\\\nbe borne in mind, that a rifle will carry shot quite well enough, on an\\\\r\\\\nemergency. Probably No. 7 is the most convenient size for shot, as the\\\\r\\\\nbirds are likely to be tame; and also because a traveller can often fire\\\\r\\\\ninto a covey or dense flight of birds--and the more pellets, the more\\\\r\\\\nexecution. If birds are to be killed for stuffing, dust-shot will also be\\\\r\\\\nwanted; otherwise, it is undoubtedly better to take only one size of\\\\r\\\\nshot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShot is made in manufactories, as follows:--Arsenic is added to the\\\\r\\\\nlead, in the proportion of from 3 lbs. to 8 lbs. of arsenic to 1000 lbs.\\\\r\\\\nof lead. The melted lead is poured through cullenders drilled with very\\\\r\\\\nfine holes, and drops many feet down, into a tub of water; 100 feet fall\\\\r\\\\nis necessary for manufactories in which No. 4 shot is made; 150, for\\\\r\\\\nlarger sorts. If the shot turns out to be lens-shaped, there has been too\\\\r\\\\nmuch arsenic; if hollow, flattened, or tailed, there has been too little.\\\\r\\\\nPewter or tin is bad, as it makes tailed shot. The Shot are sorted by\\\\r\\\\nsieves; bad shot are weeded out, by letting the shot roll over a\\\\r\\\\nslightly-inclined board, then the sho that are not quite round roll off\\\\r\\\\nto the side. Lastly, the shot is smoothed by being shaken up in a barrel\\\\r\\\\nwith a little black-lead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSlugs are wanted both for night-shooting and also in case of a hostile\\\\r\\\\nattack. They can be made by running melted lead into reeds, and chopping\\\\r\\\\nthe reeds into short length; or by casting the lead in tubes made by\\\\r\\\\nrolling paper round a smooth stick: whether reeds or paper be used, they\\\\r\\\\nshould be planted in the ground before the lead is poured in. The\\\\r\\\\ntemperature of the lead is regulated by taking care that a small quantity\\\\r\\\\nof it remains unmelted in the ladle, at the moment of pouring out: if it\\\\r\\\\nbe too hot it will burn the paper. (See \\\\\\\"Lead.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHINTS ON SHOOTING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen lying down.--Loading.--Put in the powder as you best can, and ram\\\\r\\\\nthe bullet home, lying flat on your back, with the barrel of the gun\\\\r\\\\nathwart your breast. It is easy to load in this way with cartridges.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn Horseback.--Loading.--Empty the charge of powder from the flask into\\\\r\\\\nthe left hand, and pour it down the gun; then take a bullet, wet out of\\\\r\\\\nyour mouth, and drop it into the barrel, using no ramrod; the wet will\\\\r\\\\ncake the bullet pretty firmly in its right place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFiring.--\\\\\\\"In firing, do not bring the gun to your shoulder; but present\\\\r\\\\nit across the pommel of the saddle, calculating the angle with your eye,\\\\r\\\\nand steadying yourself momentarily by standing in the stirrups, as you\\\\r\\\\ntake aim.\\\\\\\" (Palliser.) In each bound of the horse, the moment when his\\\\r\\\\nfore legs strike the ground is one of comparative steadiness, and is\\\\r\\\\ntherefore the proper instant for pulling the trigger.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn Water.--Boat-shooting.--A landing-net should be taken in the boat,\\\\r\\\\nas Colonel Hawker well advises, to pick up the dead birds as they float\\\\r\\\\non the water, while the boat passes quickly by them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShooting over Water.--When shooting from a river-bank without boat or\\\\r\\\\ndog, take a long light string with a stick tied to one end of it, the\\\\r\\\\nother being held in the hand: by throwing The stick beyond the floating\\\\r\\\\nbird, it can gradually be drawn in. The stick should be 1 1/2 or 2 feet\\\\r\\\\nlong, 2 inches in diameter, and notched at either end, and attached to\\\\r\\\\nthe hand-line by a couple of strings, each 6 feet long, tied round either\\\\r\\\\nnotch. Thus, the hand-line terminates in a triangle (see the figure I\\\\r\\\\nhave given, of a rude Stirrup), the two sides of which are of string,\\\\r\\\\nwith the stick for a base. A stout stick of this kind can be thrown to a\\\\r\\\\ngreat distance; either it may be \\\\\\\"heaved,\\\\\\\" as a sailor's Deep-sea Lead,\\\\r\\\\nor it may be whirled round the head, and then let fly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNight-shooting.--Tie a band of white paper round the muzzle of the gun,\\\\r\\\\nbehind the sight. Mr. Andersson, who has had very great experience, ties\\\\r\\\\nthe paper, not round the smooth barrel, but over the sight and all; and,\\\\r\\\\nif the sight does not happen to be a large one, he ties a piece of thick\\\\r\\\\nstring round the barrel, or uses other similar contrivance, to tilt up\\\\r\\\\nthe fore end of the paper. By this means, the paper is not entirely lost\\\\r\\\\nsight of at the moment when the aim is being taken. Mr. Andersson also\\\\r\\\\npinches the paper into a ridge along the middle of the gun, to ensure a\\\\r\\\\nmore defined foresight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNocturnal Animals.--There are a large number of night-feeding animals,\\\\r\\\\nupon whose flesh a traveller might easily support himself, but of whose\\\\r\\\\nexistence he would have few indications by daylight observation only. The\\\\r\\\\nfollowing remarks of Professor Owen, in respect to Australia are very\\\\r\\\\nsuggestive:--\\\\\\\"All the marsupial animals--and it is one of their curious\\\\r\\\\npeculiarities--are nocturnal. Even the kangaroo, which is the least so,\\\\r\\\\nis scarcely ever seen feeding out on the plains in broad daylight: it\\\\r\\\\nprefers the early morning dawn, or the short twilight; and, above all,\\\\r\\\\nthe bright moonlight nights. With regard to most of the other Australian\\\\r\\\\nforms of marsupial animals, they are most strictly nocturnal; so that, if\\\\r\\\\na traveller were not aware of that peculiarity, he might fancy himself\\\\r\\\\ntraversing a country destitute of the mammalian grade of animal life. If,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, after a weary day's journey, he could be awakened, and were to\\\\r\\\\nlook out about the moonlight glade or scrub, or if he were to set traps\\\\r\\\\nby night, he would probably be surprised to find how great a number of\\\\r\\\\ninteresting forms of mammalian animals were to Be met with, in places\\\\r\\\\nwhere there was not the slightest appearance of them in the daytime.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBattues.--In Sweden, where hundreds of people are marshalled, each man\\\\r\\\\nhas a number, and the number is chalked upon his hat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScarecrows.--A string with feathers tied to it at intervals, like the\\\\r\\\\ntail of a boy's kite, will scare most animals of the deer tribe, by their\\\\r\\\\nfluttering; and, in want of a sufficient force of men, passes may be\\\\r\\\\nclosed by this contrivance. The Swedes use \\\\\\\"lappar,\\\\\\\" viz. Pieces of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas, of half the height of a man, painted in glaring colours and left\\\\r\\\\nto flutter from a line.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Lloyd tells us of a peasant who, when walking without a gun, saw a\\\\r\\\\nglutton up in a tree. He at once took off his hat and coat and rigged out\\\\r\\\\na scarecrow, the counterpart of himself, which he fixed close by, for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose of frightening the beast from coming down; he then went leisurely\\\\r\\\\nhome, to fetch his gun: this notable expedient succeeded perfectly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStalking-horses.--Artificial.--A stalking-horse, or cow, is made by\\\\r\\\\ncutting out a piece of strong canvas into the shape of the animal, and\\\\r\\\\npainting it properly. Loops are sewn in different places, through which\\\\r\\\\nsticks are passed, to stretch the curves into shape: a stake, planted in\\\\r\\\\nthe ground serves as a buttress to support the apparatus: at a proper\\\\r\\\\nheight, there is a loophole to fire through. It packs up into a roll of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas and a bundle of five or six sticks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of stalking-horse as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBushes are used much in the same way. Colonel Hawker made a contrivance\\\\r\\\\nupon wheels which he pushed before him. The Esquimaux shoot seals by\\\\r\\\\npushing a white screen before them over the ice, on a sledge. See figure.\\\\r\\\\n- (Kane.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReal.--Both horses and oxen can be trained to shield a sportsman: they\\\\r\\\\nare said to enter into the spirit of the Thing; and to show wonderful\\\\r\\\\ncraft, walking round and round the object in narrowing circles, and\\\\r\\\\nstopping to graze unconcernedly, on witnessing the least sign of alarm.\\\\r\\\\nOxen are taught to obey a touch on the horn: the common but cruel way of\\\\r\\\\ntraining them is to hammer and batter the horns for hours together, and\\\\r\\\\non many days successively: they then become inflamed at the root and are\\\\r\\\\nhighly sensitive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPan-hunting (used at salt-licks).--\\\\\\\"Pan-hunting is a method of hunting\\\\r\\\\ndeer at night. An iron pan attached to a long stick, serving as a handle,\\\\r\\\\nis carried in the left hand over the left shoulder; near where the hand\\\\r\\\\ngrasps the handle, in a small projecting stick, forming a fork on which\\\\r\\\\nto rest the rifle, when firing. The pan is filled with burning\\\\r\\\\npine-knots, which, being saturated with turpentine, shed a brilliant and\\\\r\\\\nconstant light all around; shining into the eyes of any deer that may\\\\r\\\\ncome in that direction, and making them look like two balls of fire. The\\\\r\\\\neffect is most curious to those unaccumstomed to it. The distance between\\\\r\\\\nthe eyes of the deer as he approaches, appears gradually to increase,\\\\r\\\\nreminding one of the lamps of a travelling carriage.\\\\\\\" (Palliser.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe rush of an enraged Animal is far more easily avoided than is usually\\\\r\\\\nsupposed. The way the Spanish bull-fighters play with the bull, is well\\\\r\\\\nknown: any man can avoid a mere headlong charge. Even the speed of a\\\\r\\\\nracer, which is undeniably far greater than any wild quadruped, does not\\\\r\\\\nexceed 30 miles an hour or four times the speed of a man. The speed of an\\\\r\\\\nordinary horse is not more than 24 miles an hour: now even the fastest\\\\r\\\\nwild beast is unable to catch an ordinary horse, except by crawling\\\\r\\\\nunobserved close to his side, and springing upon him; therefore I am\\\\r\\\\nconvinced that the rush of no wild animal exceeds 24 miles an hour, or\\\\r\\\\nthree times the speed of a man. (See Measurements of the rate of an\\\\r\\\\nanimal's gallop, p. 37.) It is perfectly easy for a person who is cool,\\\\r\\\\nto avoid an animal, by dodging to one side or other of a bush. Few\\\\r\\\\nanimals turn, if the rush be unsuccessful. The buffalo is an exception;\\\\r\\\\nhe regularly hunts a man, and is therefore peculiarly dangerous.\\\\r\\\\nUnthinking persons talk of the fearful rapidity of a lion or tiger's\\\\r\\\\nspring. It is not rapid at all: it is a slow movement, as must be evident\\\\r\\\\nfrom The following consideration. No wild animal can leap ten yards, and\\\\r\\\\nthey all make a high trajectory in their leaps. Now, think of the speed\\\\r\\\\nof a ball thrown, or rather pitched, with just sufficient force to be\\\\r\\\\ncaught by a person ten yards off: it is a mere nothing. The catcher can\\\\r\\\\nplay with it as he likes; he has even time to turn after it, if thrown\\\\r\\\\nwide. But the speed of a springing animal is undeniably the same as that\\\\r\\\\nof a ball, thrown so as to make a flight of equal length and height in\\\\r\\\\nthe air. The corollary to all this is, that, if charged, you must keep\\\\r\\\\ncool and watchful, and your chance of escape is far greater than\\\\r\\\\nnon-sportsmen would imagine. The blow of the free paw is far swifter than\\\\r\\\\nthe bound.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDogs kept at bay.--A correspondent assures me that \\\\\\\"a dog flying at a\\\\r\\\\nman may be successfully repelled by means of a stout stick held\\\\r\\\\nhorizontally, a hand at each end, and used to thrust the dog backwards\\\\r\\\\nover, by meeting him across the throat or breast. If followed by a blow\\\\r\\\\non the nose, as the brute is falling, the result will be sooner\\\\r\\\\nattained.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA watch-dog usually desists from flying at a stranger when he seats\\\\r\\\\nhimself quietly on the ground, like Ulysses. The dog then contents\\\\r\\\\nhimself with barking and keeping guard until his master arrives.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHiding Game.--In hiding game from birds of prey, brush it over, and they\\\\r\\\\nwill seldom find it out; birds cannot smell well, but they have keen\\\\r\\\\neyes. The meat should be hung from an overhanging bough; then, if the\\\\r\\\\nbirds find it out, there will be no place for them to stand on and tear\\\\r\\\\nit. Leaving a handkerchief or a short to flutter from a tree, will scare\\\\r\\\\nanimals of prey for a short time. (See \\\\\\\"Scarecrows.\\\\\\\"_\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTying up your Horse.--You may tie your horse, on a bare plain, to the\\\\r\\\\nhorns of an animal that you have shot, while you are skinning him, but it\\\\r\\\\nis better to hobble the horse with a stirrup-leather. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Shooting-horse.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDivision of Game.--Some rules are necessary in these matters, to avoid\\\\r\\\\ndisputes, especially between whites and natives; and therefore the custom\\\\r\\\\nof the country must be attended to. But it is a very general and\\\\r\\\\nconvenient rule (though, like all fixed rules, often unfair) that the\\\\r\\\\nanimal should belong to the Man who first wounded him, however slight the\\\\r\\\\nwound might have been; but that he or they who actually killed the\\\\r\\\\nanimal, should have a right to a slice of the meat: it must however, be\\\\r\\\\nunderstood, that the man who gave the first wound should not\\\\r\\\\nthenceforward withdraw from the chase; if he does so, his claim is lost.\\\\r\\\\nIn America the skin belongs to the first shot, the carcase is divided\\\\r\\\\nequally among the whole party. Whaling crews are bound by similar\\\\r\\\\ncustoms, in which nice distinctions are made, and which have all the\\\\r\\\\nforce of laws.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuck-shooting.--Wooden ducks, ballasted with lead, and painted, may be\\\\r\\\\nused at night as decoy-ducks; or the skins of birds already shot, may be\\\\r\\\\nstuffed and employed for the same purpose. They should be anchored in the\\\\r\\\\nwater, or made fast to a frame attached to the shooting-punt, and dressed\\\\r\\\\nwith sedge. It is convenient to sink a large barrel into the flat marsh\\\\r\\\\nor mud, as a dry place to stand or sit in, when waiting for the birds to\\\\r\\\\ncome. A lady suggests to me, that if the sportsman took a bottle of hot\\\\r\\\\nwater to put under his feet, it would be a great comfort to him, and in\\\\r\\\\nthis I quite agree; I would take a keg of hot water, when about it. If\\\\r\\\\nreal ducks be used as decoy-birds, the males should be tied in one place\\\\r\\\\nand the females in another, to induce them to quack. An artificial island\\\\r\\\\nmay be made to attract ducks, when there is no real one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCrocodile-shooting.--Mr. Gilby says, speaking of Egypt, \\\\\\\"I killed\\\\r\\\\nseveral crocodiles by digging pits on the sand-islands and sleeping a\\\\r\\\\npart of the night in them; a dry shred of palm-branch, the colour of the\\\\r\\\\nsand, round the hole, formed a screen to put the gun through. Their flesh\\\\r\\\\nwas most excellent eating--half-way between meat and fish: I had it\\\\r\\\\nseveral times. The difficulty of shooting them was, that the falcons and\\\\r\\\\nspurwing-plovers would hover round the pit, when the crocodiles\\\\r\\\\ninvariably took to the water. Their sight and hearing were good, but\\\\r\\\\ntheir scent indifferent. I generally got a shot or two at daybreak after\\\\r\\\\nsleeping in the pit.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTracks.--When the neighbourhood of a drinking-place is trodden down with\\\\r\\\\ntracks, \\\\\\\"describe a circle a little distance From it, to ascertain if it\\\\r\\\\nbe much frequented. This is the manner in which spoor should at all times\\\\r\\\\nbe sought for.\\\\\\\" (Cumming's 'Life in South Africa.') To know if a burrow\\\\r\\\\nbe tenanted, go to work on the same principle; but, if the ground be\\\\r\\\\nhard, sprinkle sand over it, in order to show the tracks more clearly. It\\\\r\\\\nis related in the Apocrypha, that the prophet Daniel did this, when he\\\\r\\\\nwished to learn who it really was who every night consumed the meat which\\\\r\\\\nwas placed before the idol of Bel, and which the idol itself was supposed\\\\r\\\\nto eat: he thus discovered that the priests and their families had a\\\\r\\\\nsecret door by which they entered the temple; and convinced the king of\\\\r\\\\nthe matter, by showing him their footprints.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarrying Game.--To carry small Game, as Fallow Deer.--Make a long slit\\\\r\\\\nwith your knife between the back sinew and the bone of both of the\\\\r\\\\nhind-legs. Cut a thick pole of wood and a stout wooden skewer 8 inches\\\\r\\\\nlong. Now thrust the right fore-leg through the slit in the left hind\\\\r\\\\none, and then the left fore-leg through the slit in the right hind one,\\\\r\\\\nand holding these firmly in their places, push the skewer right through\\\\r\\\\nthe left fore-leg, so as to peg it from drawing back. Lastly run the pole\\\\r\\\\nbetween the animal's legs and its body, and let two men carry it on their\\\\r\\\\nshoulders, one at each end of the pole; or, if a beast of burden be at\\\\r\\\\nhand, the carcase is in a very convenient shape for being packed. In\\\\r\\\\nanimals whose back sinew is not very prominent, it is best to cross the\\\\r\\\\nlegs as above, and to lash them together. Always take the bowels out of\\\\r\\\\ngame, before carrying it; it is so much weight saved. \\\\\\\"I rode out\\\\r\\\\naccompanied by an after-rider, and shot two springboks, which we bore to\\\\r\\\\ncamp secured on our horses behind our saddles, by passing the buckles of\\\\r\\\\nthe girths on each side through the fore and hind legs of the antelopes,\\\\r\\\\nhaving first performed an incision between the bone and the sinews with\\\\r\\\\nthe couteau de chasse, according to colonial usage.\\\\\\\" (Cumming's 'Life in\\\\r\\\\nSouth Africa.') \\\\\\\"After he had skinned and gutted the animal, he cut away\\\\r\\\\nthe flesh from the bones, in one piece, without separating the limbs, so\\\\r\\\\nas to leave suspended from the tree merely the skeleton of the deer.\\\\r\\\\nThis, it appeared, was the Turkish fashion in use upon long Journeys, in\\\\r\\\\norder to relieve travellers from the useless burden of bones.\\\\\\\" (Huc's\\\\r\\\\n'Tartary.') See also the section on \\\\\\\"Heavy weights, to raise and carry,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nespecially Mr. Wyndham's plan.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo float carcases of Game across a river.--Sir S. Baker recommends\\\\r\\\\nstripping off the skin of the animal, as though it were intended to make\\\\r\\\\na water-skin of it: putting a stone up the neck end of the skin; thus\\\\r\\\\nforming a water-tight sack, open at one end only. All the flesh is now to\\\\r\\\\nbe cut off the bones, and packed into the sack; which is then to be\\\\r\\\\ninflated, and secured by tying up the open end. The skin of a large\\\\r\\\\nantelope thus inflated, will not only float the whole of the flesh, but\\\\r\\\\nwill also support several swimmers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"To carry Ivory on pack-animals, the North African traders use nets,\\\\r\\\\nslinging two large teeth on each side of an ass. Small teeth are wrapped\\\\r\\\\nup in skins and secured with rope.\\\\\\\" (Mungo Park.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSetting a gun as a spring-gun.--General Remarks.--The string that goes\\\\r\\\\nacross the pathway should be dark coloured, and so fine that, if the\\\\r\\\\nbeast struggles against it, it should break rather than cause injury to\\\\r\\\\nthe gun. I must however, add, that in the numerous cases in which I have\\\\r\\\\nwitnessed or heard of guns being set with success, for large beasts of\\\\r\\\\nprey, I have never known of injury occurring to the gun. The height of\\\\r\\\\nthe muzzle should be properly arranged with regard to the height of the\\\\r\\\\nexpected animal; thus, the heart of a hyena is the height of a man's knee\\\\r\\\\nabove the ground; that of a lion, is a span higher. The string should not\\\\r\\\\nbe tight, but hang in a bow, or the animal will cause the gun to go off\\\\r\\\\non first touching the string, and will only receive a flesh-wound across\\\\r\\\\nthe front of his chest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1st Method.--The annexed sketch (p. 258) explains the method I have\\\\r\\\\ndescribed in previous editions of this book. The stock is firmly lashed\\\\r\\\\nto a tree, and the muzzle to a stake planted in the ground. A\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"lever-stick,\\\\\\\" 8 inches long, is bound across the grip of the gun so as\\\\r\\\\nto stand upright; but it is not bound so tightly as to prevent a slight\\\\r\\\\ndegree of movement. The bottom of the \\\\\\\"lever-stick\\\\\\\" is tied to the\\\\r\\\\ntrigger, and the top of it to a long, fine, dark-coloured string, which\\\\r\\\\nis passed through the empty ramrod tubes, and is fixed to a tree on the\\\\r\\\\nother side of the pathway. It is evident that when a beast breasts this\\\\r\\\\nstring, the trigger of the gun will be pulled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of man setting up gun to be fired as above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1nd Method.--I have, however, been subsequently informed of a better\\\\r\\\\nplan of adapting the \\\\\\\"lever-stick.\\\\\\\" It is shown in the accompanying\\\\r\\\\ndiagram (below). The fault of the previous plan, is the trouble of tying\\\\r\\\\nthe string to the trigger; since the curvature is usually such as to make\\\\r\\\\nit a matter of some painstaking to fix it securely. A, B, C, is the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"lever-stick.\\\\\\\" Notch it deeply at A, where it is to receive the trigger;\\\\r\\\\nnotch it also at B, half an inch from A; and at C, 5 inches or so from B.\\\\r\\\\nIn lashing B to the grip of the stock at D, the firmer you make the\\\\r\\\\nlashing, the better. If D admit of any yielding movement, on C being\\\\r\\\\npulled, the gun will not go off, either readily or surely; as will easily\\\\r\\\\nbe seen, on making experiment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of rifle with stick rigged as above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n3rd Method.--I am indebted to Captain J. Meaden for the following\\\\r\\\\naccount of the plan used in Ceylon for setting a spring gun for\\\\r\\\\nleopards:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Remove the sear, or tie up the trigger. Load the gun, and secure it at\\\\r\\\\nthe proper height from the ground. Opposite the muzzle of the gun, or at\\\\r\\\\nsuch distance to the right, or left, as may be required, fasted the end\\\\r\\\\nof a black string, or line made of horsehair or fibre, and pass it across\\\\r\\\\nthe path to the gun. Fasten the other end to a stake, long enough to\\\\r\\\\nstand higher than the hammer. Stick the end of the stake slightly in the\\\\r\\\\nground, and let it rest upright against the lock projection, the black\\\\r\\\\nline being fastened nearly at that height. Pass round the small of the\\\\r\\\\nstock a loop of single or double string. Take a piece of stick 6 or 8\\\\r\\\\ninches long, pass through the loop, and twist tourniquet fashion until\\\\r\\\\nthe loop is reduced to the required length. Raise the hammer carefully,\\\\r\\\\nand pass the short end of the lever-stick, from the inner to the outer\\\\r\\\\nside, over the comb, and let the long end of the lever rest against the\\\\r\\\\nstake: the pressure of the hammer will keep the lever steady against the\\\\r\\\\nstake. To prevent the lower end of the stake flying out, from the\\\\r\\\\npressure of the lever on the upper part, place a log or stone against the\\\\r\\\\nfoot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"An animal pushing against the black string, draws the upper end of the\\\\r\\\\nstake towards the muzzle, until the lever is disengaged and releases the\\\\r\\\\nhammer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"In laying the long arm of the lever against the stake sufficient play\\\\r\\\\nmust be allowed for the contraction of the black string, when wet by dew\\\\r\\\\nor rain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"If a double gun is set, two stakes and two levers will be required. The\\\\r\\\\nstakes to be connected above and below the gun, by cross sticks. The\\\\r\\\\nlevers must be passed round the combs the opposite way, to allow of the\\\\r\\\\nlong arms pressing outwards from the gun, and enable the levers to\\\\r\\\\ndisengage without entangling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The carcase or live bait must be hedged round, and means adopted to\\\\r\\\\nguide the leopard across the string, by running out a short hedge on one\\\\r\\\\nside. In this case the black line to be set taut, and some 4 inches from\\\\r\\\\nthe line of fire. The breast than catches the string, and the push\\\\r\\\\nreleases the hammer when the muzzle is in line with the chest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"On this principle, two or more guns can be set, slightly varying in\\\\r\\\\nelevation, to allow of one barrel at least being effective.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBow and Arrow set for Beasts.--The Chinese have some equivalent\\\\r\\\\ncontrivance with bows and arrows. M. Huc tells us that a simply\\\\r\\\\nconstructed machine is sold in the shops, by which, when sprung, a number\\\\r\\\\nof poisoned arrows are fired off in succession. These machines are\\\\r\\\\nplanted in caves of sepulture, to guard them from pillage. They use\\\\r\\\\nspring-guns, and used to have spring-bows in Sweden, and in many other\\\\r\\\\ncountries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKnives.--Hunting-knife.--A great hunting-knife is a useless\\\\r\\\\nencumbrance: no old sportsman or traveller cares to encumber himself with\\\\r\\\\none; but a butcher's knife, carried in a sheath, is excellent, both from\\\\r\\\\nits efficient shape, the soft quality of The steel, its lightness, and\\\\r\\\\nthe strong way in which the blade is set in the haft.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPocket-knife.--If a traveller wants a pocket-knife full of all kinds of\\\\r\\\\ntools, he had best order a very light one of 2 3/4 inches long, in a\\\\r\\\\ntortoise-shell handle, without the usual turnscrew at the end. It should\\\\r\\\\nhave a light \\\\\\\"picker\\\\\\\" to shut over its back; this will act as a\\\\r\\\\nstrike-light, and a file also, if its under surface be properly\\\\r\\\\nroughened. Underneath the picker, there should be a small triangular\\\\r\\\\nborer, for making holes in leather, and a gimlet. The front of the knife\\\\r\\\\nshould contain a long, narrow pen-blade of soft steel; a cobbler's awl,\\\\r\\\\nslightly bent; and a packing-needle with a large eye, to push thongs and\\\\r\\\\ntwine through holes in leather. Between the tortoise-shell part of the\\\\r\\\\nhandle and the metal frame of the knife, should be a space to contain\\\\r\\\\nthree flat thin pieces of steel, turning on the same pivot. The ends of\\\\r\\\\nthese are to be ground to form turnscrews of brass instruments: when this\\\\r\\\\nexcellent contrivance is used, it must be opened out like the letter T,\\\\r\\\\nthe foot of which represents the turnscrew in use and the horizontal part\\\\r\\\\nrepresents the other two turnscrews, which serve as the handle. It may be\\\\r\\\\nthought advisable to add a button-hook, a corkscrew, and a large blade;\\\\r\\\\nbut that is not my recommendation, because it increases the size of the\\\\r\\\\nknife and makes it heavy; now a heavy knife is apt to be laid by, and not\\\\r\\\\nto be at hand when wanted, while a light knife is a constant pocket\\\\r\\\\ncompanion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSheath Knives, to carry.--They are easily carried by half-naked,\\\\r\\\\npocketless savages, by attaching the sheaths to a leather-loop, through\\\\r\\\\nwhich the left forearm and elbow are to be passed. A swimmer can easily\\\\r\\\\ncarry a knife in this way; otherwise he holds it between his teeth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitutes for Knives.--Steel is no doubt vastly better than iron, but\\\\r\\\\nit is not essential for the ordinary purposes of life; indeed, most\\\\r\\\\nancient civilized nations had nothing better than iron. Any bit of good\\\\r\\\\niron may be heated as hot as the camp-fire admits; hammered flat, lashed\\\\r\\\\ninto a handle, and sharpened on a stone. A fragment of flint or obsidian\\\\r\\\\nmay be made fast to a handle, to be used as a carpenter cuts paper With a\\\\r\\\\nchisel; namely, by holding it dagger-fashion, and drawing it over the\\\\r\\\\nskin or flesh which he wishes to cut. Shells are sometimes employed as\\\\r\\\\nsubstitutes for knives, also thin strips of bamboo, the sharp edges of\\\\r\\\\nwhich cut meat easily. (See \\\\\\\"Sharpening Tools.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNight-glass.--Opera-glasses are invaluable as night-glasses, for, by\\\\r\\\\ntheir aid, the sight of man is raised nearly to a par with that of\\\\r\\\\nnight-roving animals; therefore, a sportsman would find them of great\\\\r\\\\nservice when watching for game at night. A small and inexpensive glass is\\\\r\\\\nas useful for this purpose as a large one; but there is a considerable\\\\r\\\\ndifference between the clearness of different opera-glasses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOTHER MEANS OF CAPTURING GAME.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--A trapper will never succeed, unless he thoroughly\\\\r\\\\nenters into the habits of life and mind of wild animals. He must ever\\\\r\\\\nbear in mind how suspicious they are; how quickly their eye is caught by\\\\r\\\\nunusual traces; and, lastly, how strong and enduring a taint is left by\\\\r\\\\nthe human touch. Our own senses do not make us aware of what it is\\\\r\\\\ndisagreeable enough to acknowledge, that the whole species of man yields\\\\r\\\\na powerful and wide-spreading emanation, that is utterly disgusting and\\\\r\\\\nrepulsive to every animal in its wild state. It requires some experience\\\\r\\\\nto realise this fact: a man must frequently have watched the heads of a\\\\r\\\\nherd of far distant animals, tossed up in alarm the moment that they\\\\r\\\\ncatch his wind; he must have observed the tracks of animals--how, when\\\\r\\\\nthey crossed his path of the preceding day, the beast that made the\\\\r\\\\ntracks has stopped, scrutinised, and shunned it--before he can believe\\\\r\\\\nwhat a Yahoo he is among the brute creation. No cleanliness of the\\\\r\\\\nindividual seems to diminish this remarkable odour: indeed, the more\\\\r\\\\ncivilised the man, the more subtle does it appear to be; the touch of a\\\\r\\\\ngame-keeper scares less than that of the master, and the touch of a negro\\\\r\\\\nor bushman less than that of a traveller from Europe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf a novice thinks he will trap successfully by such artless endeavours\\\\r\\\\nas putting a bait on the plate of a trap that is covered over with moss,\\\\r\\\\nor by digging a pitfall in the middle of a wild beast's track, he is\\\\r\\\\nutterly mistaken. The bait Should be thrown on the ground, and the trap\\\\r\\\\nplaced on the way to it; then the animal's mind, being fixed on the meat,\\\\r\\\\ntakes less heed of the footpath. Or a pitfall should be made near the\\\\r\\\\nmain path; this being subsequently stopped by boughs, causes the animal\\\\r\\\\nto walk in the bushes, and to tumble into the covered hole. The slightest\\\\r\\\\nthing diverts an animal's step: watch a wild beast's path across a forest\\\\r\\\\n--little twigs and tufts of grass will be seen to have changed its\\\\r\\\\ncourse, and caused it to curve. It is in trifles of this sort that the\\\\r\\\\ntrapper should look for auxiliaries. After setting traps, Mr. St. John\\\\r\\\\nrecommends the use of a small branch of a tree; first, to smooth the\\\\r\\\\nground, and then, having dipped it in water, to sprinkle the place: this\\\\r\\\\nentirely obliterates all foot-marks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpringes.--General Remarks.--Harden the wood of which the mechanism has\\\\r\\\\nto be made, by means of fire; either baking it in hot sand or ashes, or\\\\r\\\\notherwise applying heat to a degree just short of charring its surface.\\\\r\\\\nThe mechanism will then retain the sharpness of its edges under a\\\\r\\\\ncontinuance of pressure, and during many hours of wet weather. The\\\\r\\\\nslighter the strain on the springe, the more delicately can its mechanism\\\\r\\\\nbe set.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNooses.--Catgut (which see) makes better nooses than string, because it\\\\r\\\\nis stiff enough to keep in shape when set: brass wife that has been\\\\r\\\\nheated red-hot, is excellent; for it has no tendency whatever to twist,\\\\r\\\\nand yet is perfectly pliable. Fish-hooks are sometimes attached to\\\\r\\\\nspringes; sometimes a tree is bent down and a strong cord is used for the\\\\r\\\\nnoose, by which large animals are strangled up in the air, as leopards\\\\r\\\\nare in Abyssinia. A noose may be set in any place where there is a run;\\\\r\\\\nit can be kept spread out, by thin rushes or twigs set crosswise in it.\\\\r\\\\nIf the animal it is set for can gnaw, a heavy stone should be loosely\\\\r\\\\npropped up, which the animal in its struggles may set free, and by the\\\\r\\\\nweight of which it may be hung up and strangled. It is a very convenient\\\\r\\\\nplan for a traveller who has not time to look for runs, to make little\\\\r\\\\nhedges across a creek, or at right angles to a clump of trees, and to set\\\\r\\\\nhis snares in gaps left in these artificial hedges. On the same\\\\r\\\\nprinciple, artificial islands of piles and faggots Are commonly made in\\\\r\\\\nlakes that are destitute of any real ones, in order that they may become\\\\r\\\\na resort of wild-fowl.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJavelins.--Heavy poisoned javelins, hung over elephant and hippopotamus\\\\r\\\\npaths, and dropped on a catch being touched, after the manner of a\\\\r\\\\nspringe, are used generally in Africa. They sometimes consist of a \\\\\\\"sharp\\\\r\\\\nlittle assegai, or spike, most thoroughly poisoned, and stuck firmly into\\\\r\\\\nthe end of a heavy block of thornwood, about four feet long and five\\\\r\\\\ninches in diameter. This formidable affair is suspended over the centre\\\\r\\\\nof a sea-cow path, at about thirty feet from the ground, by a bark cord,\\\\r\\\\nwhich passes over a high branch of a tree, and thence, by a peg, on one\\\\r\\\\nside of a path beneath.\\\\\\\" (Gordon Cumming.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrigger.--Where a trigger has to release a strong spring, an arrangement\\\\r\\\\non the principle of a figure of 4 trap is, I believe, the most delicate;\\\\r\\\\nthe standard may be a branch or the stock of a tree; and the other pieces\\\\r\\\\nshould be hardened by fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPitfalls.--Very small pitfalls, with sharpened stakes, planted inside\\\\r\\\\nthem, that have been baked hard by the fire and well poisoned, are easily\\\\r\\\\nto be set, but they are very dangerous to man and beast. In preparing a\\\\r\\\\npitfall for animals of prey, it is usual to ascertain whether they are\\\\r\\\\ndeep enough, by putting in a large dog; if he cannot get out, it is very\\\\r\\\\nunlikely that any wild beast can. (See \\\\\\\"Trous de loup,\\\\\\\" p. 312.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPitfalls are often dug in great numbers, near frequented watering-places,\\\\r\\\\nto which numerous intersecting paths lead: by stopping up particular\\\\r\\\\npaths, the pitfalls can be brought separately into use; therefore, those\\\\r\\\\npitfalls need never be employed in which animals have been freshly\\\\r\\\\nkilled, and where the smell of blood would scare the game. It is\\\\r\\\\ndifficult to prevent the covers of pitfalls becoming hollow: the only way\\\\r\\\\nis to build the roofs in somewhat of an arch, so as to allow for\\\\r\\\\nsubsidence. If a herd of animals be driven over pitfalls, some are sure\\\\r\\\\nto be pushed in, as the crush makes it impossible for the beasts, however\\\\r\\\\nwary, to pick their way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUganda Thorn-wreath.--Captain Grant found a very ingenious contrivance\\\\r\\\\nin use in Uganda, in Africa. Two small Stout hoops of equal diameter,\\\\r\\\\nmade of wood fully an inch in thickness, were lashed one above the other;\\\\r\\\\nlong acacia thorns were interposed, forming the spokes of a wheel of\\\\r\\\\nwhich the hoops formed the rim. The bases of the thorns were nipped\\\\r\\\\nbetween the hoops; and their points radiated towards the centre. A great\\\\r\\\\nmany thorns were used, so that the appearance was that of a wheel without\\\\r\\\\na nave, whose spokes were so close together that they touched each other,\\\\r\\\\nand, as thorns taper from base to point, the spokes touched one another\\\\r\\\\nalong their whole length, from circumference to centre. This apparatus is\\\\r\\\\nalways made with great neatness. It is laid over a hole 18 inches deep,\\\\r\\\\ndug in the beast's path, and the noose of a cord, of which the other end\\\\r\\\\nis secured to a log, is laid closely within the upper hoop. When the\\\\r\\\\nbeast treads on the apparatus, he crashes through the thorns, but, on\\\\r\\\\nwithdrawing his foot from the hole, the wreath clings to his fetlock like\\\\r\\\\na ruff, and prevents the noose from slipping off. Thus there is time for\\\\r\\\\nthe noose to become firmly jammed during the struggles of the beast. Of\\\\r\\\\ncourse, the trapper artfully bushes the path, so as to induce him to step\\\\r\\\\nfull upon the trap. He sets a great many of them, and they require no\\\\r\\\\nlooking after. The diameter of the hoops is made proportionate to the\\\\r\\\\nsize of the beast for which they are intended. Six inches interior\\\\r\\\\ndiameter was the size used for buffalo and hartebeest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTraps.--Steel traps should never be tied fast, or the captured animal\\\\r\\\\nmay struggle loose, or even gnaw off his leg. It is best to cut small\\\\r\\\\nbushes, and merely to secure the traps to their cut ends. Steel traps are\\\\r\\\\nof but little use to a traveller.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHawks are trapped by selecting a bare tree, that stands in an open space:\\\\r\\\\nits top is sawn off level, and a trap is put upon it: the bait is laid\\\\r\\\\nsomewhere near, on the ground: the bird is sure to visit the pole, either\\\\r\\\\nbefore or after he has fed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoison.--Savages frequently poison the water of drinking-places, and\\\\r\\\\nfollow, capture, and eat the poisoned animals. Nux vomica or strychnine\\\\r\\\\nis a very dangerous poison to use, but it affords the best means of\\\\r\\\\nridding a neighbourhood of noxious beasts and birds: if employed to kill\\\\r\\\\nbeasts, put it in the belly; if, birds, in the eye, of the bait. Meat for\\\\r\\\\nkilling Beasts should be set after nightfall; else the crows and other\\\\r\\\\nbirds will be sure to find it out, and eat it up before the beasts have\\\\r\\\\ntime to discover it. It would be unsafe to eat an animal killed with\\\\r\\\\nstrychnine, on account of the deadliness of the poison.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Swedes put fulminating-powder in a raw shankbone, and throw it down\\\\r\\\\nto the wolves; when one of these gnaws and crunches it, it blows his head\\\\r\\\\nto atoms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoisoned Bullets.--I take the following extract from 'Galignani's\\\\r\\\\nMessenger:'--\\\\\\\"A new method of catching whales is now being tried with\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable success, science having contributed to its discovery. Our\\\\r\\\\nreaders are well aware of the deadly effects of the Indian poison called\\\\r\\\\nwurare, or woorali, concerning which we have often had occasion to record\\\\r\\\\nthe most interesting experiments, especially in mentioning the attempts\\\\r\\\\nmade to use it as a specific for lockjaw, its peculiar action consisting\\\\r\\\\nin relaxing the muscular system. Strychnine is a poison producing the\\\\r\\\\ncontrary effect, the excessive contraction of that system, or, in other\\\\r\\\\nwords, tetanus, or lockjaw. It is a curious fact that by the conjunction\\\\r\\\\nof these two agents, so diametrically opposite in their effects, a poison\\\\r\\\\nis obtained that will kill almost instantly if only administered in the\\\\r\\\\ndose of half a milligramme per kilogramme of the animal to be subjected\\\\r\\\\nto its action, provided its weight do not exceed ten kilogrammes. If\\\\r\\\\nlarger, the dose must be proportionally increased. M. Thiercelin, the\\\\r\\\\ninventor of this poison, composes it by mixing a salt of strychnine with\\\\r\\\\none-twentieth of woorali. To apply it to whale fishing, he makes the\\\\r\\\\ncompound up into cartridges of thirty grammes (an ounce) each, which is\\\\r\\\\nenough to kill an animal of 60,000 kilogrammes weight. Each cartridge is\\\\r\\\\nimbedded in the gunpowder contained in an explosive shell which is fired\\\\r\\\\noff on the whale. In a late whaling voyage ten whales received such\\\\r\\\\nmissiles, and all died within from four to eighteen minutes after the\\\\r\\\\ninfliction of the wound. Out of these ten whales, six were cut up for\\\\r\\\\ntheir blubber and whalebone. Their remains were handled by careless men,\\\\r\\\\nwho frequently had scratches and sores on their skin, and yet not one of\\\\r\\\\nthem suffered the slightest injury, a circumstance which Shows that the\\\\r\\\\npoison cannot be transmitted from the fish to the men. Its poisonous\\\\r\\\\naction on the whale is, however, so great that practically the dose will\\\\r\\\\nhave to be diminished, so that the death of the creature may not be so\\\\r\\\\nsudden. We should not forget to state that two out of the ten whales\\\\r\\\\nabove mentioned were lost by one of the many accidents incident to\\\\r\\\\nwhaling, and that two others were of a kind that is not worth fishing\\\\r\\\\nfor.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoisoned Arrows.--Arrows are most readily poisoned by steeping a thread\\\\r\\\\nin the juice, and wrapping it round the barbs. Serpents' venom may always\\\\r\\\\nbe used with effect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBird-lime can be made from the middle bark of most parasitic plants, that\\\\r\\\\nis to say, those that grow like mistletoe, out of the boughs of other\\\\r\\\\ntrees. Holly and young elder shoots also afford it. The bark is boiled\\\\r\\\\nfor seven or eight hours, till quite soft, and is then drained of its\\\\r\\\\nwater and laid in heaps, in pits dug in the ground, where it is covered\\\\r\\\\nwith stones and left for two or three weeks to ferment; but less time is\\\\r\\\\nrequired, if the weather be hot. It is watered from time to time, if\\\\r\\\\nnecessary. In this way, it passes into a mucilaginous state; and is then\\\\r\\\\npounded into a paste, washed in running water, and kneaded till it is\\\\r\\\\nfree from dirt and chips. Lastly, it is left for four or five days in\\\\r\\\\nearthen vessels, to ferment and purify itself, when it becomes fit for\\\\r\\\\nuse. It ought to be greenish, sour, gluey, stringy, and sticky. It\\\\r\\\\nbecomes brittle when dry, and may be powdered; but, on being wetted, it\\\\r\\\\nbecomes sticky again. (Ure's Dictionary.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVast flocks of birds frequent the scattered watering-places of dry\\\\r\\\\ncountries at nightfall and at daybreak: by liming the sedges and bushes\\\\r\\\\nthat grow about them, numbers of birds could be caught.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCrows may be killed by twisting up a piece of paper like an extinguisher,\\\\r\\\\ndropping a piece of meat in it, and smearing its sides with bird-lime.\\\\r\\\\nWhen the bird pokes his head in, his eyes are gummed up and blinded; and\\\\r\\\\nhe towers upwards in the air, whence he soon falls down exhausted, and,\\\\r\\\\nit may be, dead with fright. (Lloyd.) Fish-hooks, baited with meat, are\\\\r\\\\ngood to catch these sorts of birds.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCatching with the Hand.--Ducks.--We hear of Hindoos who, taking\\\\r\\\\nadvantage of the many gourds floating on their waters, put one of them on\\\\r\\\\ntheir heads, and wade in among wild ducks; they pull them down, one after\\\\r\\\\nanother, by their legs, under water; wring their necks, and tie them to\\\\r\\\\ntheir girdle. But in Australia, a swimmer binds grass and rushes, or\\\\r\\\\nweeds, round his head; and takes a long fishing-rod, with a slip noose\\\\r\\\\nworking over the pliant twig that forms the last joint of the rod. When\\\\r\\\\nhe comes near, he gently raises the end, and, putting the noose over the\\\\r\\\\nhead of the bird, draws it under water to him. He thus catches one after\\\\r\\\\nanother, and tucks the caught ones in his belt. A windy day is generally\\\\r\\\\nchosen, because the water is ruffled. (Eyre.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCondors and Vultures are caught by spreading a raw ox-hide, under which a\\\\r\\\\nman creeps, with a piece of string in his hand, while one or two other\\\\r\\\\nmen are posted in ambush close by, to give assistance at the proper\\\\r\\\\nmoment. When the bird flies down upon the bait, his legs are seized by\\\\r\\\\nthe man underneath the skin, and are tied within it, as in a bag. All his\\\\r\\\\nflapping is then useless; he cannot do mischief with his claws, and he is\\\\r\\\\neasily overpowered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBolas.--The bolas consists of three balls, composed either of lead or\\\\r\\\\nstone; two of them are heavy, but the third is rather lighter: they are\\\\r\\\\nfastened to long elastic strings, made of twisted sinews, and the ends of\\\\r\\\\nthe strings are all tied together. The Indian holds the lightest of the\\\\r\\\\nthree balls in his hand, and swings the two others in a wide circle above\\\\r\\\\nhis head; then taking his aim, at the distance of about fifteen or twenty\\\\r\\\\npaces, he lets go the hand-ball; all the three balls whirl in a circle,\\\\r\\\\nand twine round the object aimed at. The aim is usually taken at the\\\\r\\\\nhind-legs of the animals, and, the cords twisted round them, they become\\\\r\\\\nfirmly bound. It requires great skill and long practice to throw the boas\\\\r\\\\ndexterously, especially when on horseback. A novice in the art incurs the\\\\r\\\\nrisk of dangerously hurting either himself or his horse, by not giving\\\\r\\\\nthe balls the proper swing, or by letting go the hand-ball too soon.\\\\r\\\\n(Tschudi's 'Peru.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLasso.--It is useless that I should enter into details about making and\\\\r\\\\nwielding the lasso, for it is impossible to become Moderately adept in\\\\r\\\\nits use, without months of instruction and practice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmstringing.--Animals are hamstrung by riding at them, armed with a sort\\\\r\\\\nof spear; the blade of which is fixed at right angles to the shaft, and\\\\r\\\\nhas a cutting edge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHawking is a disappointing pursuit, owing to the frequent loss of hawks;\\\\r\\\\nand can hardly be carried on except in a hawking country, where the\\\\r\\\\nsportsman has a better chance than elsewhere, both of recovering and\\\\r\\\\nreplacing them; it is impracticable except where the land is open and\\\\r\\\\nbare; and it is quite a science. There are some amateurs who will not\\\\r\\\\nhear a word of disparagement about their hawks, but the decided\\\\r\\\\nimpression that I bear away with me from all I have learnt, is, that the\\\\r\\\\nbirds are rarely affectionate or intelligent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFISHING.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFishing-tackle.--Fish-hooks are made of iron, not steel, wire. While the\\\\r\\\\npiece of wire is straight, it is laid along a little groove in a block of\\\\r\\\\nwood, and there barbed by the stroke of a chisel, slantwise across it.\\\\r\\\\nThe other end is flattened by a tap of the hammer, or roughened, that it\\\\r\\\\nmay be held by the whipping; then the point is sharpened by a file, and\\\\r\\\\nfinished on a stone. The proper curvature is next given, and then the\\\\r\\\\nhook is case-hardened (see \\\\\\\"Case-hardening\\\\\\\"); lastly, the proper temper\\\\r\\\\nis given, by heating the hook red-hot, and quenching it in grease.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA traveller should always take a few hooks with him: they should be of\\\\r\\\\nthe very small and also of the middling-sized sorts; he might have a\\\\r\\\\ndozen of each sort whipped on to gut; and at least a couple of\\\\r\\\\ncasting-lines, with which to use them: also several dozens of tinned iron\\\\r\\\\nfish-hooks, of various sizes, such as are used at sea; and plenty of\\\\r\\\\nline.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFishing-lines.--Twisted sinews will make a fishing-line. To make a\\\\r\\\\nstrong fine line, unravel a good silk handkerchief, and twist the threads\\\\r\\\\ninto a whipcord. (See also \\\\\\\"Substitutes for String.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGut is made from silkworms; but the scrapings of the membrane in the\\\\r\\\\nmanufacture of catgut (see \\\\\\\"Sinew-thread\\\\\\\") Make a fine, strong, and\\\\r\\\\nsomewhat transparent thread: twisted horsehair can almost always be\\\\r\\\\nobtained: and boiling this in soap-lees, takes away its oiliness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShoemakers' Wax is made by boiling together common resin and any kind of\\\\r\\\\nsoft grease, which does not contain salt, such as oil or butter. A sixth\\\\r\\\\nor seventh part of pitch makes it more tough, but it is not absolutely\\\\r\\\\nnecessary for making the wax. Try if the quantity of grease is sufficient\\\\r\\\\nby dipping the stick with which the wax is stirred, into water to cool\\\\r\\\\nit. When the wax is supposed to be successfully made, pour it into water,\\\\r\\\\nthen taking it out while yet soft, pull it and stretch it with your wet\\\\r\\\\nhands as much as it will bear; do this over and over again, after dipping\\\\r\\\\nit in lukewarm water, till it is quite tough. Wax is used of different\\\\r\\\\ndegrees of hardness, according as the weather is warm or cold.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReel. If you have no reel, make a couple of gimlet-holes, six inches\\\\r\\\\napart, in the butt of your rod, at the place where the reel is usually\\\\r\\\\nclamped; drive wooden pegs into these, and wind your spare line round\\\\r\\\\nthem, as in fig. 1.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1: illustration as described above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe pegs should not be quite square with the butt, but should slope a\\\\r\\\\nlittle, each away from the other, that the line may be better retained on\\\\r\\\\nthem.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n{Fig. 2 and Fig 3--line as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA long line is conveniently wound on a square frame, as shown in the\\\\r\\\\nannexed sketch (fig. 2); and a shorter line, as in fig. 3.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you have no equivalent for a reel, and if your tackle is slight, and\\\\r\\\\nthe fish likely to be large, provide yourself with A bladder or other\\\\r\\\\nfloat; tie it to the line, and cast the whole adrift.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrimmers are well known, and are a convenient way of fishing the middle\\\\r\\\\nof a pool, with only a short line. Anything will do for the float--a\\\\r\\\\nbladder or a bottle is very good.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo recover a lost Line, make a drag of a small bushy tree with plenty of\\\\r\\\\nbranches, that are so lopped off as to leave spikes on the trunk. This is\\\\r\\\\nto be weighted with a stone, and dragged along the bottom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOtters.--What is called \\\\\\\"an otter\\\\\\\" is useful to a person on the shore of\\\\r\\\\na wide river or lake which he has no other means of fishing: it is a very\\\\r\\\\nsuccessful at first, but soon scares the fish; therefore it is better\\\\r\\\\nsuited to a traveller than to an ordinary sportsman. It is made as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--A board of light wood, fourteen inches long and eight inches\\\\r\\\\nhigh, or thereabouts, is heavily weighted along its lower edge, so as to\\\\r\\\\nfloat upright in the water; a string like the bellyband of a kite, and\\\\r\\\\nfor the same purpose, is fastened to it; and to this belly-band the end\\\\r\\\\nof a line, furnished with a dozen hooks at intervals, is tied. As the\\\\r\\\\nfisherman walks along the bank, the otter runs away from him, and carries\\\\r\\\\nhis line and hooks far out into the stream. It is very convenient to have\\\\r\\\\na large hand-reel to wind and unwind the line upon; but a forked stick\\\\r\\\\nwill do very well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoat fishing.--In fishing with a long ground-line and many hooks, it is\\\\r\\\\nof importance to avoid entanglements; make a box in which to coil the\\\\r\\\\nline, and a great many deep saw-cuts across the sides, into which the\\\\r\\\\nthin short lines, to which the hooks are whipped, may be jammed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFishermen who do not use oars, but paddles, tie a loop to their line:\\\\r\\\\nthey put their thumb through the loop, and fish while they paddle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo see Things deep under Water, such as dead seals, use a long box or\\\\r\\\\ntube with a piece of glass at the lower end; this removes entirely the\\\\r\\\\nglare of the water and the effects of a rippled surface. Mr. Campbell, of\\\\r\\\\nIslay, suggests that a small glass window might be let into the bottom of\\\\r\\\\nthe boat: Plate-glass would be amply strong enough. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Water-spectacles.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNets.--A small square net may be best turned to account by sinking it in\\\\r\\\\nholes and other parts of a river which fish frequent; throwing in bait to\\\\r\\\\nattract them over it; and then hauling up suddenly. The arrangement shown\\\\r\\\\nin the figure is very common. A seine net may be furnished with bladder\\\\r\\\\nfor floats, or else with pieces of light wood charred to make them more\\\\r\\\\nbuoyant. The hauling-ropes may be made of bark steeped for three weeks,\\\\r\\\\ntill the inner bark separates from the outer, when the latter is twisted\\\\r\\\\ninto a rope. (Lloyd.) Wherever small fish are swimming in shoals near the\\\\r\\\\nsurface, there the water is sure to be rippled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of net arrangement as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpearing Fish.--The weapon used (sometimes called the \\\\\\\"grains\\\\\\\") is\\\\r\\\\nidentical with Neptune's or Britannia's trident, only the prongs should\\\\r\\\\nbe more numerous and be placed nearer together, in order to catch small\\\\r\\\\nfish: the length of the handle gives steadiness to the blow. In spearing\\\\r\\\\nby torchlight, a broad oval piece of bark is coated with wet mud, and in\\\\r\\\\nit a blazing fire is lighted. It is fixed on a stage, or it is held in\\\\r\\\\nthe bow of the boat, so high as to be above the spearman's eyes. He can\\\\r\\\\nsee everything by its light, especially if the water be not above four\\\\r\\\\nfeet deep, and the bottom sandy. But there are not many kinds of wood\\\\r\\\\nthat will burn with a sufficiently bright flame; the dry bark of some\\\\r\\\\nresinous tree is often used. If tarred rope can be obtained, it may\\\\r\\\\nsimply be wound round a pole fixed in the bow of the boat, and lighted.\\\\r\\\\nFish can also be shot with a bow and a barbed arrow, to which a string is\\\\r\\\\nattached.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIntoxicating Fish.--Lime thrown into a pond will kill the fish; and the\\\\r\\\\nsimilar but far more energetic properties of Cocculus Indicus are well\\\\r\\\\nknown. Throughout tropical Africa and in South America, the natives catch\\\\r\\\\nfish by poisoning them. Dams are made, which, when the river is very low,\\\\r\\\\nEnclose deep pools of water with no current; into these the poison is\\\\r\\\\nthrown: it intoxicates the fish, which float and are taken by the hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOtters, Cormorants, and Dogs.--Both otters and cormorants are trained to\\\\r\\\\ncatch fish for their masters; and dogs are trained by the Patagonians to\\\\r\\\\ndrive fish into the nets, and to frighten them from breaking loose when\\\\r\\\\nthe net is being hauled in. Cormorants, in China, fish during the winter\\\\r\\\\nfrom October to May, working from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., at which hour their\\\\r\\\\ndinner is given to them. When they fish, a straw tie is put round their\\\\r\\\\nnecks, to keep them from swallowing the fish, but not so tight as to slip\\\\r\\\\ndown and choke them. A boat takes out ten or twelve of these birds. They\\\\r\\\\nobey the voice: if they are disobedient, the water near them is struck\\\\r\\\\nwith the back of the oar; as soon as one of them has caught a fish, he is\\\\r\\\\ncalled to the boat, and the oar is held out for him to step upon. It\\\\r\\\\nrequires caution to train a cormorant, because the bird has a habit, when\\\\r\\\\nangry, of striking with its beak at its instructor's eye with an\\\\r\\\\nexceedingly rapid and sure stroke.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSIGNALS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nColomb and Bolton's flashing signals, adopted in our Army and Navy, and\\\\r\\\\nused in many other countries as well, are eminently suited to the wants\\\\r\\\\nof an expedition. Anything may be used for signalling, that appears and\\\\r\\\\ndisappears, like a lantern, or an opened and closed umbrella, or that\\\\r\\\\nmoves, as a waved flag or a person walking to and fro on the crest of a\\\\r\\\\nhill against the sky. Sound also can be employed, as long and short\\\\r\\\\nwhistles. Their use can be thoroughly taught in two hours, and however\\\\r\\\\nsmall the practice of the operators, communication, though slow, is\\\\r\\\\nfairly accurate, while in practised hands its rapidity is astonishing.\\\\r\\\\nThe proportion of time occupied by the flashes and intervals is as\\\\r\\\\nfollows. (I extract all the rest of the article from the pamphlet\\\\r\\\\npublished by the inventors of the system.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlashing Signals, with Flags.--Supposing the short flash to be half a\\\\r\\\\nsecond in duration, the long flash should be fully a second and a half.\\\\r\\\\nThe interval between the flashes forming a figure should be equal to a\\\\r\\\\nshort flash, and the interval between two figures should be equal to a\\\\r\\\\nlong flash. After the last figure of the signal is finished, there should\\\\r\\\\nbe a pause equal to at least one-third of the time taken up by the\\\\r\\\\nfigures. After this pause, the signal should be again repeated with the\\\\r\\\\nsame measured flashes and intervals, and so continued until answered by\\\\r\\\\nall to whom it is addressed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Example of Morse code].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCare must be taken never to commence a fresh signal before the answers to\\\\r\\\\nthe last have ceased; and signals are never to be answered until their\\\\r\\\\nrepetitions have been observed a sufficient number of times to make an\\\\r\\\\nerror impossible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 1 and Fig 2--sketch of signalling with flags as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe signalman may work from left to right, or from right to left, as\\\\r\\\\nshown in figs. 1 and 2, according to convenience and the direction of the\\\\r\\\\nwind. To make a short flash, the flag is waved from a to b, and back to\\\\r\\\\nthe normal position a. To make a long flash, the flag is waved from a to\\\\r\\\\nc, and back to the normal position a.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe numerals 1 to 5 are, therefore, denoted by one to five waves of the\\\\r\\\\nflag from a to b, recovering to a.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe numeral 6 by a wave from a to c, recovering to a. The numeral 7 by a\\\\r\\\\nwave from a to b, back to a, and then to c, recovering to the normal\\\\r\\\\nposition a. The numeral 8 is denoted by a wave from a to c, back to a,\\\\r\\\\nand then to b, recovering to the normal position a. The numeral 9 is\\\\r\\\\ndenoted by two waves from a to b, and one from a to c. The numeral 0 by\\\\r\\\\none wave from a to c, recovering again to a, and then two waves from a to\\\\r\\\\nb. The other signs are made in the same manner, so that a short motion\\\\r\\\\nshall always represent a short flash, and a long motion a long flash.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn the completion of the motions required for each sign, the flag must\\\\r\\\\nalways be brought to the position a. When the word, or group of figures,\\\\r\\\\nis completed, the flag may be lowered in front of the body.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn receiving a message, the flag should always be kept in the position a,\\\\r\\\\nexcept when answering.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn waving the flag, the point of the staff should be made to describe a\\\\r\\\\nfigure of 8 in the air to keep the flag clear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEach signal party must consist of not less than two men, whose duties\\\\r\\\\nwill be as follows:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn receiving messages: No. 1 works the flag for answering, etc., and\\\\r\\\\nrefers to the code for the interpretation of the numbers received, and\\\\r\\\\ncalls out the words to No. 2. No. 2 fixes the telescope and reads from\\\\r\\\\nthe distant station, calling out the numbers as they are made for the\\\\r\\\\ninformation of No. 1, and writes down the numbers and meaning thereof.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSuppose station \\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\" in communication with station \\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\":--No. 1 at \\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\" on\\\\r\\\\nbeing told by No. 2 that \\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\" is about to send a message, takes up his\\\\r\\\\nposition at attention, holding the flag over the left arm and under the\\\\r\\\\nright, or vice versa across his body, according to the wind, with the\\\\r\\\\ncode book in his hand. No. 2 fixes his eyes on the glass, and on\\\\r\\\\nreceiving the numbers from \\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\" calls them out to No. 1, who ascertains\\\\r\\\\ntheir meaning from the code, and gives the words to No. 2, who writes\\\\r\\\\nthem down in his book, and then placing his eye to the glass, tells No. 1\\\\r\\\\nto make the answer. No. 2 does not, however, direct the answer to be made\\\\r\\\\nuntil he is sure of the correctness of the signal received.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlashing Alphabet, for Use without a Code.--The following alphabet,\\\\r\\\\netc., can be used under circumstances when it is not convenient or\\\\r\\\\npossible to have recourse to the Signal Book, and forms in itself a\\\\r\\\\nperfect telegraphic system, necessarily somewhat slow in its application,\\\\r\\\\nbut having the great advantage of requiring very little previous\\\\r\\\\nknowledge and practice to work with correctness. The symbols and numbers\\\\r\\\\nexpressing the alphabet are identical with those forming the alphabet in\\\\r\\\\nthe Signal Book.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Chart with code signals].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll particulars as to the machines and lanterns used in the Service, for\\\\r\\\\nmaking these flashing signals, and the code, can be procured at W. Nunn and\\\\r\\\\nCo.'s Army and Navy Lamp and Signal Works, 65, George Street East,\\\\r\\\\nLondon, E.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To attract the notice of a division\\\\r\\\\nof your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass\\\\r\\\\nin the sun, throwing its flash towards where you expect them to be. It is\\\\r\\\\nquite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will\\\\r\\\\ncatch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is. It\\\\r\\\\nis now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It\\\\r\\\\nshould be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than\\\\r\\\\none that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer;\\\\r\\\\ntherefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find\\\\r\\\\nthe steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly\\\\r\\\\nagainst the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the\\\\r\\\\nsame distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each\\\\r\\\\npoint of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical\\\\r\\\\nangle is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a\\\\r\\\\nflash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no\\\\r\\\\nappreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the\\\\r\\\\nflash is visible. That area is the section of the fasciculus of cones\\\\r\\\\nthat proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have\\\\r\\\\nsupposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single\\\\r\\\\npoint. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon\\\\r\\\\na very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the\\\\r\\\\nmirror; but as he retreats from the object, the edges of the flash become\\\\r\\\\nrounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely\\\\r\\\\nthe same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short,\\\\r\\\\nlook just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of\\\\r\\\\nlight to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will\\\\r\\\\nproceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident\\\\r\\\\nthat a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object.\\\\r\\\\nThe steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more\\\\r\\\\nnor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object\\\\r\\\\nof the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror\\\\r\\\\ncauses the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe power of these sun-signals is extraordinarily great. The result of\\\\r\\\\nseveral experiments that I made in England showed that the smallest\\\\r\\\\nmirror visible under atmospheric conditions such that the signaller's\\\\r\\\\nstation was discernible, but dim, subtended an angle of only one-tenth of\\\\r\\\\na second of a degree. It is very important that the mirror should be of\\\\r\\\\ntruly plane and parallel glass, such as instrument-makers procure; the\\\\r\\\\nindex glass of a full-sized sextant is very suitable for this purpose:\\\\r\\\\nthere is a loss of power when there is any imperfection in the glass. A\\\\r\\\\nplane mirror only three inches across, reflects as much of the sun as a\\\\r\\\\nglobe of 120 feet diameter; it looks like a dazzling star at ten miles'\\\\r\\\\ndistance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo direct the flash of the Mirror.--There are makeshift ways of\\\\r\\\\ndirecting the flash of the mirror; as, by observing its play on an object\\\\r\\\\nsome paces off, nearly in line with the station it is wished to\\\\r\\\\ncommunicate with. In doing this, two cautions are requisite: first, the\\\\r\\\\ndistance of the object must be so large compared to the diameter of the\\\\r\\\\nmirror that the play of the flash shall appear truly circular and exactly\\\\r\\\\nlike a faint sun (see preceding paragraph): secondly, be careful to bring\\\\r\\\\nthe eye to the very edge of the mirror; there should be as little\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"dispart\\\\\\\" as possible, as artillerymen would say. Unless these cautions\\\\r\\\\nbe attended to very strictly, the flash will never be seen at the distant\\\\r\\\\nstation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of arrangement as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn object, in reality of a white colour but apparently dark, owing to its\\\\r\\\\nbeing shaded, shows the play of a mirror's flash better than any other.\\\\r\\\\nThe play of a flash, sent through an open window, on the walls of a room,\\\\r\\\\ncan be seen at upwards of 100 yards. It is a good object by which to\\\\r\\\\nadjust my hand heliostat, which I describe below. Two bits of paper and a\\\\r\\\\ncouple of sticks, arranged as in the drawing, serve pretty well to direct\\\\r\\\\na flash. Sight the distant object through the holes in the two bits of\\\\r\\\\npaper, A and B, at the ends of the horizontal stick; and when you are\\\\r\\\\nsatisfied that the stick is properly adjusted and quite steady, take your\\\\r\\\\nmirror and throw the shadow of A upon B, and further endeavour to throw\\\\r\\\\nthe white speck in the shadow of A, corresponding to its pin-hole in it,\\\\r\\\\nthrough the centre of the hole in B. Every now and then lay the mirror\\\\r\\\\naside, and bend down to see that A B continues to be properly adjusted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHand Heliostat.--Some years ago, I took great pains to contrive a\\\\r\\\\nconvenient pocket instrument, by which a traveller should be able to\\\\r\\\\nsignal with the sun, and direct his flash with certainty, in whatever\\\\r\\\\ndirection he desired. I did so in the belief that a signalling power of\\\\r\\\\nextraordinary intensity could thus be made use of; and, I am glad to say,\\\\r\\\\nI succeeded in my attempt. I at last obtained a pretty pocket instrument,\\\\r\\\\nthe design of which I placed in the hands of Messrs. Troughton and Simms;\\\\r\\\\nand upon the earlier models of which I read a paper before the British\\\\r\\\\nAssociation in 1858. I called it a \\\\\\\"hand heliostat.\\\\\\\" I always carry one\\\\r\\\\nwhen I travel, for it is a continual source of amusement. The instrument\\\\r\\\\nis shown in fig. 1 (p. 280), and its principle is illustrated by fig. 2.\\\\r\\\\nThe scale is about 2/3.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nE is the eye of the signaller; M the mirror; and L, S, fig. 2, a tube\\\\r\\\\ncontaining at one end, L, a lens, and at the other, S, a screen of white\\\\r\\\\nporcelain or unpolished ivory, placed at the exact solar focus of L: a\\\\r\\\\nshade, K, with two holes in it, is placed before L. Let R, r, be portions\\\\r\\\\nof a large pencil of parallel rays, proceeding from any one point on the\\\\r\\\\nsun's surface, and reflected from the mirror, as R' r' (fig. 2). R'\\\\r\\\\nimpinges upon the lens, L, through one of the holes in K, and R' goes\\\\r\\\\nfree toward some distant point, O. Those that impinge on the lens will be\\\\r\\\\nbrought to a focus on S, where a bright speck of light might be seen.\\\\r\\\\nThis speck radiates light in all direction; some of the rays, proceeding\\\\r\\\\nfrom it, impinge on the lens at the other hole in the shade K, as shown\\\\r\\\\nin fig. 2, and are reduced by its agency to parallelism with r' and R',\\\\r\\\\nthat is, with the rays that originally left the mirror: consequently E,\\\\r\\\\nlooking partly at the edge of the lens, and partly into space, sees a\\\\r\\\\nbright speck of light in the former, coincident with the point O in the\\\\r\\\\nlatter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig 1 and Fig 2, as described in the text].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat is true for one point in the sun's disc, is true for every point in\\\\r\\\\nit. Accordingly, the signaller sees an image of the sun, and not a mere\\\\r\\\\nspeck of light, in the lens; and the part of the landscape which that\\\\r\\\\nimage appears to overlay, is precisely that part of it over which the\\\\r\\\\nflash from his mirror extends; or, in other words, it is that from any\\\\r\\\\npoint of which a distant spectator may see some part or other of the\\\\r\\\\nsun's disc reflected in the mirror. There is no difficulty in signalling\\\\r\\\\nwhen the sun is far behind the back, if the eye-tubes are made to pull\\\\r\\\\nout to a total length of five inches, otherwise the shadow of the head\\\\r\\\\ninterferes. For want of space, the drawing represents the tubes as only\\\\r\\\\npartly drawn out. The instrument is perfectly easy to manage, and letters\\\\r\\\\ncan be signalled by flashes. Its power is perfectly marvellous. On a day\\\\r\\\\nso hazy that colours on the largest scale--such as green fields and white\\\\r\\\\nhouses--are barely distinguishable at seven miles' distance, a\\\\r\\\\nlooking-glass no larger than the finger-nail transmits its signals\\\\r\\\\nclearly visible to the naked eye.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI have made a makeshift arrangement on the principle of my heliostat,\\\\r\\\\nusing the object glass of an opera-glass for the lens, and an ordinary\\\\r\\\\nlooking-glass: the great size and short focus of the object glass is a\\\\r\\\\ngreat convenience when using a mirror with a wide frame.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProfessor W. H. Miller, the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society, has\\\\r\\\\nsince invented a yet more compact method of directing the flash, which he\\\\r\\\\nhas described in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1865. It\\\\r\\\\nconsists of a plate of silvered glass, one of whose rectangular corners\\\\r\\\\nis accurately ground and polished. On looking into the corner when the\\\\r\\\\nglass is properly held an image of the sun is seen, which overlays the\\\\r\\\\nactual flash. Beautifully simple as this instrument is, I do not like it\\\\r\\\\nso much as my own, for the very fact of its requiring no \\\\\\\"setting\\\\\\\" is its\\\\r\\\\ndrawback. With mine, when the image of the sun is lost it is immediately\\\\r\\\\nfound again by simply rotating the instrument on its axis; but with\\\\r\\\\nProfessor Miller's the image must be felt for wholly anew.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFire Signals.--Fire-beacons, hanging up a lantern, or setting fire to an\\\\r\\\\nold nest high up in a tree, serve as night-signals; but they are never to\\\\r\\\\nbe depended on without previous concert, as bushes and undulations of the\\\\r\\\\nground will often hide them entirely. The sparks from a well-struck flint\\\\r\\\\nand steel can be seen for much more than a mile.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmoke Signals.--The smoke of fires is seen very far by day; and green\\\\r\\\\nwood and rotten wood make the most smoke. It is best to make two fires\\\\r\\\\n100 yards apart, lest your signalling should be mistaken for an ordinary\\\\r\\\\nfire in the bush. These double fires are a very common signal to vessels\\\\r\\\\nin the offing, on the African coast.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Signals.--By Sight.--A common signal for a distant scout is, that\\\\r\\\\nhe should ride or walk round and round in a circle from right to left, or\\\\r\\\\nelse in one from left to right.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Parkyns, speaking of Abyssinia, describes the habits of a caste of\\\\r\\\\nrobbers in the following words:--\\\\\\\"At other times they will lie concealed\\\\r\\\\nnear a road, with scouts in every direction on the look-out; yet no one\\\\r\\\\nventuring to speak, but only making known by signs what he may have to\\\\r\\\\ncommunicate to his companions or leader. Thus he will point to his ear\\\\r\\\\nand foot on hearing footsteps, to his eyes on seeing persons approach, or\\\\r\\\\nto his tongue if voices be audible; and will also indicate on his fingers\\\\r\\\\nthe numbers of those coming, describing also many particulars as to how\\\\r\\\\nmany porters, beasts of burden or for riding, there may be with the\\\\r\\\\nparty.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA kite has been suggested as a day signal; and also a kite with some kind\\\\r\\\\nof squib, let off by a slow-light and attached to its tail, as one by\\\\r\\\\nnight. (Colonel Jackson.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSound.--Whistling through the fingers can be heard at considerable\\\\r\\\\ndistances: the accomplishment should be learnt. Cooing in the Australian\\\\r\\\\nfashion, or jvdling in that of the Swiss, are both of them heard a long\\\\r\\\\nway. The united holloa of many voices, is heard much further than\\\\r\\\\nseparate cries. The cracking of a whip has a very penetrating sound.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmells.--An abominable smell arrests the attention at night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLetters carried by Animals.--In short reconnoitring expeditions made by a\\\\r\\\\nsmall detachment from a party, the cattle or dogs are often wild, and run\\\\r\\\\nhome to their comrades on the first opportunity; in the event of not\\\\r\\\\nbeing able to watch them, owing to accident or other cause, advantage may\\\\r\\\\nbe taken of their restlessness, by tying a note to one of their necks,\\\\r\\\\nand letting them go and serve as postmen, or rather as carrier-pigeons.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBEARINGS BY COMPASS, SUN, ETC.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPocket Compass.--A pocket compass should not be too small; if one of the\\\\r\\\\nlittle toy compasses be carried in the pocket, it should be as a reserve,\\\\r\\\\nand not for regular use. A toy compass will of course tell N. from\\\\r\\\\nN.N.E., and the like; and that may be very useful information, but the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller will find that he constantly needs more precise directions. He\\\\r\\\\ndoubts the identity of some hill or the destination of some path, and\\\\r\\\\nfinds on referring to his map, that the difference of bearing upon which\\\\r\\\\nhe must base his conclusion, is small: he therefore requires a good sized\\\\r\\\\ncompass, to determine the bearing with certainty. One from 1 1/2 to 2\\\\r\\\\ninches in diameter is practically the best. It should have plenty of\\\\r\\\\ndepth, so that the card may traverse freely, even when the instrument is\\\\r\\\\ninclined: it should be light in weight, that it may not be easily jarred\\\\r\\\\nby a blow; the catch that relieves the card, when the instrument is\\\\r\\\\nclosed, should be self-acting and should act well: lastly the movements\\\\r\\\\nof the needle should be quick; one that makes slow oscillations should be\\\\r\\\\nperemptorily refused, whatever its other merits may be: the graduation of\\\\r\\\\nthe degrees on the card should be from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, North\\\\r\\\\nbeing 0 degrees and East 90 degrees. I wish some optician would make\\\\r\\\\naluminum cards. The material can be procured as foil, like tinfoil. It\\\\r\\\\ncan then be stamped and embossed, in which case it retains its shape\\\\r\\\\nperfectly, but I cannot satisfy myself as to a good pattern, nor do I see\\\\r\\\\nhow to make the North and South halves of the disc sufficiently different\\\\r\\\\nin appearance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCompass for use at night.--The great majority of compasses are well-nigh\\\\r\\\\nuseless in the dark, that is, when it is most important to be able to\\\\r\\\\nconsult them. They are rarely so constructed, that the difference between\\\\r\\\\nthe north and south sides is visible by moonlight or by the light of a\\\\r\\\\ncigar or piece of tinder. The more modern contrivances are very\\\\r\\\\neffective; in these the southern half of the compass card is painted\\\\r\\\\nblack, the northern being left white. With a very faint light, this\\\\r\\\\ndifference can be appreciated. In compasses consisting simply of a\\\\r\\\\nneedle, the north end of the needle should have a conspicuous arrow-head.\\\\r\\\\nIt is extraordinary how much the power of seeing a compass or a watch at\\\\r\\\\nnight is increased by looking nearly at it through a magnifying-glass.\\\\r\\\\nThus, young people who can focus their vision through a wide range may be\\\\r\\\\nobserved poring with their eyes close to their books when the light\\\\r\\\\nwanes. So again, at night-time, a placard, even in large type, is\\\\r\\\\nillegible at a short distance, but easily read on approaching it. It\\\\r\\\\nseems, in order that a faint image on the retina should be appreciated by\\\\r\\\\nthe nerves of sight, that image must have considerable extent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMoonlight or the light of a cigar may be condensed on the compass by a\\\\r\\\\nburning glass, or other substitute for it. (See \\\\\\\"Burning Glass.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrue and Magnetic Bearings.--The confusion between true and magnetic\\\\r\\\\nbearings is a continual trouble, even to the most experienced travellers.\\\\r\\\\nSir Thomas Mitchell's exploring party very nearly sustained a loss by\\\\r\\\\nmistaking the one for the other. I recommend that the points of the\\\\r\\\\ncompass, viz. North, N.N.E., etc., should be solely used for the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller for his true bearings; and the degrees, as 25 degrees (or N. 25\\\\r\\\\ndegrees E.), for his magnetic. There would then be no reason why the two\\\\r\\\\nnomenclatures should interfere with one another, for a traveller's\\\\r\\\\nrecollection of the lay of a country depends entirely upon true\\\\r\\\\nbearings--or sunrise, sunset, and the stars--and is expressed by North,\\\\r\\\\nN.N.E., etc.; but his surveying data which find no place in his memory,\\\\r\\\\nbut are simply consigned to his note-book, are necessarily registered in\\\\r\\\\ndegrees. To give every facility for carrying out this principle, a round\\\\r\\\\nof paper should be pasted in the middle of the traveller's pocket-compass\\\\r\\\\ncard, just large enough to hide the ordinary rhumbs, but leaving\\\\r\\\\nuncovered the degrees round its rim. On this disk of paper the points of\\\\r\\\\nthe compass (true bearings) should be marked so as to be as exact as\\\\r\\\\npossible for the country about to be visited.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nErrors in Magnetic Bearings.--The compass-needle is often found to be\\\\r\\\\ndisturbed, and sometimes apparently bewitched, when laid upon hill-tops;\\\\r\\\\neven when they consist of bare masses of granite. The disturbance is\\\\r\\\\neasily accounted for by the hornblende in the granite, or by other\\\\r\\\\niron-bearing rocks. Explorers naturally select hills as their points of\\\\r\\\\ntriangulation; but compass observations on hill-tops, if unchecked by a\\\\r\\\\nsextant observation of the sun's bearings, are never so reliable as those\\\\r\\\\ntaken on a plain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of card as described on following pages].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBearings by Sun and Stars.--It requires very great practice to steer well\\\\r\\\\nby stars, for, on an average, they change their bearings even faster than\\\\r\\\\nthey change their altitudes. In tropical countries, the zodiacal stars -\\\\r\\\\nas Orion and Antares--give excellent east and west points. The Great\\\\r\\\\nBear is useful when the North Pole cannot be seen, for you may calculate\\\\r\\\\nby the eye whereabout it would be in the heavens when the \\\\\\\"pointers\\\\\\\" were\\\\r\\\\nvertical, or due north; and the Southern Cross is available in precisely\\\\r\\\\nthe same way. The true North Pole is about 1 1/2 degree or 3 diameters of\\\\r\\\\nthe full moon, apart from the Pole star; and its place is on a line\\\\r\\\\nbetween the Pole Star and the Great Bear. An almanac, calculated to show\\\\r\\\\nthe bearing, and the times of moonrise and moonset, for the country to be\\\\r\\\\ntravelled over, as well as those of sunrise and sunset, would be a very\\\\r\\\\ngreat convenience; it would be worth while for a traveller accustomed to\\\\r\\\\nsuch calculations to make one for himself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiagram.--The diagram (preceding page) is intended to be traced in lines\\\\r\\\\nof different colours, when it will be found to be far less confused than\\\\r\\\\nat present.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIts object is to enable a traveller to use the sun, both as a rude watch\\\\r\\\\nand as a compass. The diagram is calculated for the latitude of London,\\\\r\\\\nbut will do with more or less accuracy for the whole of England. A\\\\r\\\\ntraveller going to other countries may easily draw up one for himself,\\\\r\\\\nand on a larger scale if he prefers it, by using the Azimuth tables and\\\\r\\\\nthe Horary tables of Lynn.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe diagram represents, 1st, circles of equal altitudes; 2ndly, the path\\\\r\\\\nof sun, stars, etc., for each 10th degree of declination; 3rdly, the hour\\\\r\\\\nangles, all projected down upon--4thly--the level compass card.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThus, six circles are drawn round the centre of the compass card at equal\\\\r\\\\ndistances apart, each ring between them representing a space of 15\\\\r\\\\ndegrees in altitude.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe following angles were then calculated for each 10th degree of\\\\r\\\\ndeclination in turns, viz.:--The height of the sun, etc., when above the\\\\r\\\\nhorizon at each point of the compass. 2ndly, the bearing of the sun at\\\\r\\\\neach consecutive hour. These points were dotted out; and, by joining the\\\\r\\\\nseveral sets of them, the drawing was made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe broken lines which diverge in curves from P are hour lines; those\\\\r\\\\nwhich surround P in more or less complete ovals, are the paths of the sun\\\\r\\\\nand stars, for each 10th degree of declination; the prominent line\\\\r\\\\nrunning from E. round to W. being its path when on the Equator.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe diagram, when it is traced out for use, should have the names of the\\\\r\\\\nmonths written in coloured ink on either side of the south line at places\\\\r\\\\ncorresponding to the declination of the sun during those months: viz.:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJanuary        S.  23 degrees  to          S.     17 degrees\\\\r\\\\nFebruary       S.  17           \\\\\\\"          S.     8\\\\r\\\\nMarch          S.   7           \\\\\\\"          N.     4\\\\r\\\\nApril          N.   5           \\\\\\\"          N.    15\\\\r\\\\nMay            N.  15           \\\\\\\"          N.    22\\\\r\\\\nJune           N.  22           \\\\\\\"          N.    23\\\\r\\\\nJuly           N.  23           \\\\\\\"          N.    18\\\\r\\\\nAugust         N.  18           \\\\\\\"          N.     8\\\\r\\\\nSeptember      N.   8           \\\\\\\"          S.     3\\\\r\\\\nOctober        S.   3           \\\\\\\"          S.    14\\\\r\\\\nNovember       S.  15           \\\\\\\"          S.    22\\\\r\\\\nDecember       S.  22           \\\\\\\"          S.    23\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo use the card.--Draw a broad pencil line, which may afterwards be\\\\r\\\\nrubbed out, corresponding to the date of travel, and there will be no\\\\r\\\\nfurther confusion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThen, to know what o'clock it is, \\\\\\\"span out\\\\\\\" (see \\\\\\\"Spanning\\\\\\\") roughly the\\\\r\\\\naltitude of the sun. The point in the diagram where the altitude so\\\\r\\\\nobtained crosses the pencil mark, corresponds to the position of the sun.\\\\r\\\\nThe hour is then read off; and the compass bearings on the diagram are\\\\r\\\\nadjusted by holding it level, and turning it round until a line, drawn\\\\r\\\\nfrom its centre through the point in question, points towards the sun. As\\\\r\\\\nto the moon or a star, if its declination be unknown, but its bearing and\\\\r\\\\naltitude being given, its declination and path may be found, and\\\\r\\\\ntherefore the time since its rising or before its setting; a most useful\\\\r\\\\npiece of information to a traveller. Watches break, and compasses cannot\\\\r\\\\nbe used on horseback without stopping, and therefore a diagram of this\\\\r\\\\ndescription, of which any number of copies can be traced out, may be of\\\\r\\\\nuse for rough purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Signs of Direction.--Bearings by the Growth of Trees.--In exposed\\\\r\\\\nsituations and near the sea, the growth of trees is rarely symmetrical;\\\\r\\\\nthey betray by their bent heads and stunted branches the direction of the\\\\r\\\\nprevalent influences most adverse to their growth. This direction is\\\\r\\\\nconstant over wide districts in a flat country, but cannot be equally\\\\r\\\\nrelied upon in a hilly one, where the mountains and valleys affect the\\\\r\\\\nconditions of shade and shelter, and deflect the course of the wind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMoss grows best where there is continuous damp, therefore it prefers that\\\\r\\\\nside of a tree which affords the most suitable combination of exposure to\\\\r\\\\ndamp winds and shelter from the sun. When the winds do not differ\\\\r\\\\nmaterially in dampness, the north side of the forest trees are the most\\\\r\\\\nthickly covered with moss.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBearings by the shape of Ant-hills.--That most accurate observer, Pierre\\\\r\\\\nHuber, writes as follows concerning the nests of the yellow ants, which\\\\r\\\\nare abundantly to be found in the Swiss Alps and in some other\\\\r\\\\nmountainous countries. It must be recollected, in reading his statement,\\\\r\\\\nthat the chief occupation of ants is to move their eggs and larvae from\\\\r\\\\none part of the nest to another, to ensure them a warm and equable\\\\r\\\\ntemperature; therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the nests of ants\\\\r\\\\nshould be built on a uniform principle as regards their shape and aspect.\\\\r\\\\nHuber says \\\\\\\"they serve as a compass to mountaineers when they are\\\\r\\\\nsurrounded by thick mists, or have lost their way during the night; they\\\\r\\\\ndo so in the following manner:--The ant-hills (of the yellow ants),\\\\r\\\\nwhich are by far more numerous and more high in the mountains than\\\\r\\\\nanywhere else, are longer than they are broad, and are of a similar\\\\r\\\\npattern in other respects. Their direction is invariably from east to\\\\r\\\\nwest. Their highest point and their steepest side are turned towards the\\\\r\\\\npoint of sunrise in the winter-time (au levant d'hiver), and they descend\\\\r\\\\nwith a gradual slope in the opposite direction. I have verified these\\\\r\\\\nexperiences of the shepherds upon thousands of ant-hills, and have found\\\\r\\\\na very small number of exceptions; these occurred only in the case where\\\\r\\\\nthe ant-hills had been disturbed by men or animals. The ant-hills do not\\\\r\\\\nmaintain the constancy of their form in the lowlands, where they are more\\\\r\\\\nexposed to such accidents.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRipple-marks on Snow or Sand.--The Siberians travel guided by the ripples\\\\r\\\\nin the snow, which run in a pretty fixed direction, owing to the\\\\r\\\\nprevalence of a particular wind. The ripples in a desert of sand are\\\\r\\\\nequally good as guides; or the wind itself, if it happens to be blowing,\\\\r\\\\nespecially to a person pushing through a tangled belt of forest. Before\\\\r\\\\nleaving a well-known track, and striking out at night into the broad open\\\\r\\\\nplain, notice well which way the wind blows as regards the course you are\\\\r\\\\nabout to pursue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlight of Birds.--I have read somewhere that in the old days coasting\\\\r\\\\nsailors occasionally took pigeons with them, and when they had lost their\\\\r\\\\nbearings they let one fly, which it did at once to the land.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo follow a Track at Night.--Where the track is well marked, showers of\\\\r\\\\nsparks, ably struck with a flint and steel, are sufficient to show it,\\\\r\\\\nwithout taking the pains of making a flame.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmell of an Old Track.--The earth of an old and well-trodden road has a\\\\r\\\\nperceptible smell, from the dung and trampling of animals passing over\\\\r\\\\nit, especially near to encampments. It is usual at night, when a guide\\\\r\\\\ndoubts whether or no he is in the track, to take up handfuls of dirt and\\\\r\\\\nsmell it. It is notorious that cattle can smell out a road.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMARKS FOR THE WAY-SIDE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMarks on Trees--Cutting Marks.--A very excellent \\\\\\\"tree-line\\\\\\\" is made by\\\\r\\\\ncutting deep notches in a line of trees, starting from some conspicuous\\\\r\\\\nobject, so that the notches will face the men that are to be guided by\\\\r\\\\nit: the trees must be so selected that three, or at least two of them,\\\\r\\\\nare in sight at once. The notch or sliced bark of a tree is called a\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"blaze\\\\\\\" in bush language. These blazed trees are of much use as\\\\r\\\\nfinger-posts on a dark night. They are best made by two persons; one\\\\r\\\\nchipping the trees on his right, and the other those on his left. If the\\\\r\\\\naxes are quite sharp, they only need to be dropped against the tree in\\\\r\\\\norder to make the chip. Doing so, hardly retards a person in his walking.\\\\r\\\\nAnother way more suitable to some kinds of forests, is to strike the\\\\r\\\\nknife into the left side of the tree, to tear down a foot of bark, and to\\\\r\\\\nleave the bark hanging, for a double extent of white surface is shown in\\\\r\\\\nthis way. Also, to break down tops of saplings and leave them hanging:\\\\r\\\\nthe undersides of the leaves being paler than the upper, and the\\\\r\\\\ndifferent lines of the reversed foliage make a broken bush to look\\\\r\\\\nunnatural among health trees, and it quickly arrests the attention. If\\\\r\\\\nyou want a tree to be well-scored or slashed, so as to draw attention to\\\\r\\\\nit without fail, fire bullets into it, as into a mark, and let the\\\\r\\\\nnatives cut them out in their own way, for the sake of the lead. They\\\\r\\\\nwill effect your purpose admirably, without suspecting it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStamping Marks on Trees.--The keepers of some of the communal forests in\\\\r\\\\nSwitzerland are provided with small axes, having the back of the axe-head\\\\r\\\\nworked into a large and sharp die, the impression of the die being some\\\\r\\\\nletter or cipher indicating the commune. When these foresters wish to\\\\r\\\\nmark a tree, they give it first a slice with the edge of the axe, and\\\\r\\\\nthen (turning the axe) they deal it a heavy blow with the back of the\\\\r\\\\naxe-head. By the first operation they prepare a clean surface for their\\\\r\\\\nmark; and, by the second, they stamp their cipher deeply into the wood.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBranding Trees.--Some explorers take branding irons, and use them to mark\\\\r\\\\neach of their camping-places with its number. This is especially useful\\\\r\\\\nin Australian travel, where the country is monotonous, and there are few\\\\r\\\\nnatives to tell the names of places.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFaggot hung to a Tree.--A bundle of grass or twigs about 2 feet long,\\\\r\\\\nslung by its middle athwart a small tree, at the level of the eye, by the\\\\r\\\\nside of a path, is well calculated to catch the attention. Its lines are\\\\r\\\\nso different to those seen elsewhere in the forest, that it would be\\\\r\\\\nscarcely possible to overlook it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoat or Canoe Routes through lakes well studded with islands, can be well\\\\r\\\\nmarked by trimming conspicuous trees until only a tuft of branches is\\\\r\\\\nleft at the top. This is called, in the parlance of the \\\\\\\"Far West,\\\\\\\" a\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"lopstick.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWooden Crosses.--A simple structure like fig. 1 is put together with a\\\\r\\\\nsingle nail or any kind of lashing. It catches the attention immediately.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 1. Sketch of cross as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMarks with Stones.--Marks cut on Stone.--I have observed a very simple\\\\r\\\\nand conspicuous permanent mark used in forest-roads, as represented in\\\\r\\\\nfig. 2. The stone is 8 inches above ground, 3 1/2 wide, 8 inches long:\\\\r\\\\nthe mark is black and deeply cut. An arrow-head may be chiselled in the\\\\r\\\\nface of a rock and filled with melted lead. With a small \\\\\\\"cold\\\\\\\" chisel, 3\\\\r\\\\ninches long and 1/4 inch wide, a great deal of stone carving may be\\\\r\\\\nreadily effected.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of stone with incised cross].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPiles of Stones.--Piles of stones are used by the Arabs in their deserts,\\\\r\\\\nand in most mountain-tracts. \\\\\\\"An immense length of the road, both in the\\\\r\\\\ngovernment of the Don Cossacks and in that of Tambov, is marked out on a\\\\r\\\\ngigantic scale by heaps of stones, varying from 4 to 6 feet high. These\\\\r\\\\nare visible from a great distance; and it is very striking to see the\\\\r\\\\ndouble row of them indicating the line of route over the Great Steppe -\\\\r\\\\nundulations which often present no other trace of the hand of man.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n(Spottiswoode.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of piled stones].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGipsy Marks.--When gipsies travel, the party that goes in advance leaves\\\\r\\\\nmarks at cross-roads, in order to guide those who follow. These marks are\\\\r\\\\ncalled \\\\\\\"patterans;\\\\\\\" there are three patterans in common use. One is to\\\\r\\\\npluck three large handfuls of grass and to throw them on the ground, at a\\\\r\\\\nshort distance from one another, in the direction taken; another is, to\\\\r\\\\ndraw a cross on the ground, with one arm much longer than the rest, as a\\\\r\\\\npointer--a cross is better than any other simple mark, for it catches\\\\r\\\\nmany different lights. (In marking a road, do not be content with marking\\\\r\\\\nthe dust--an hour's breeze or a shower will efface it; but take a\\\\r\\\\ntent-peg, or sharpened stick, and fairly break into the surface, and your\\\\r\\\\nmark will be surprisingly durable.) The third of the gipsy patterans is\\\\r\\\\nof especial use in the dark: a cleft stick is planted by the road-side,\\\\r\\\\nclose to the hedge, and in the cleft, is an arm like a signpost. The\\\\r\\\\ngipsies feel for this at cross-roads, searching for it on the left-hand\\\\r\\\\nside. (Borrow's 'Zincali.') A twig, stripped bare, with the exception of\\\\r\\\\ntwo or three leaves at its end, is sometimes laid on the road, with its\\\\r\\\\nbared end pointing forwards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther similar marks of direction and locality, in use in various parts of\\\\r\\\\nthe world are as follows:--Knotting twigs; breaking boughs, and letting\\\\r\\\\nthem dangle down; a bit of white paper in a cleft stick; spilling water,\\\\r\\\\nor liquid of any kind, on the pathway; a litter made of paper torn into\\\\r\\\\nsmall shreds, or of a stick cut into chips, or of feathers of a bird; a\\\\r\\\\nstring, with papers knotted to it, like the tail of a boy's kite--tie a\\\\r\\\\nstone to the end of it, and throw it high among the branches of a tree.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPaint.--Whitewash (which see), when mixed with salt, or grease, or glue\\\\r\\\\nsize, will stand the weather for a year or more. It can be painted on a\\\\r\\\\ntree or rock: the rougher the surface on which it is painted, the longer\\\\r\\\\nwill some sign of it remain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlack for Inscriptions is made by mixing lamp-black (which see) with some\\\\r\\\\nkind of size, grease, wax, or tar. Dr. Kane, having no other material at\\\\r\\\\nhand, once burnt a large K with gunpowder on the side of a rock. It\\\\r\\\\nproved to be a durable and efficient mark. When letters are chiselled in\\\\r\\\\na rock, they should be filled with black to make them more conspicuous.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlood leaves a mark of a dingy hue, that remains long upon a\\\\r\\\\nlight-coloured, absorbent surface, as upon the face of sandy rocks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nON FINDING THE WAY.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRecollection of a Path.--It is difficult to estimate, by recollection\\\\r\\\\nonly, the true distances between different points in a road that has been\\\\r\\\\nonce travelled over. There are many circumstances which may mislead, such\\\\r\\\\nas the accidental tedium of one part, or the pleasure of another; but\\\\r\\\\nbesides these, there is always the fact, that, in a long day's journey, a\\\\r\\\\nman's faculties of observation are more fresh and active on starting than\\\\r\\\\nlater in the day, when from the effect of weariness, even peculiar\\\\r\\\\nobjects will fail to arrest his attention. Now, as a man's recollection\\\\r\\\\nof an interval of time is, as we all know, mainly derived from the number\\\\r\\\\nof impressions that his memory has received while it was passing, it\\\\r\\\\nfollows that, so far as this cause alone is concerned, the earlier part\\\\r\\\\nof his day's journey will always seem to have been disproportionately\\\\r\\\\nlong compared to the latter. It is remarkable, on taking a long\\\\r\\\\nhalf-day's walk, and subsequently returning, after resting some hours,\\\\r\\\\nhow long a time the earlier part of the return journey seems to occupy,\\\\r\\\\nand how rapidly different well-remembered points seem to succeed each\\\\r\\\\nother, as the traveller draws homewards. In this case, the same cause\\\\r\\\\nacts in opposite directions in the two journeys.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Walk in a Straight Line through Forests.--Every man who has had\\\\r\\\\nfrequent occasion to find his way from one place to another in a forest,\\\\r\\\\ncan do so without straining his attention. Thus, in the account of Lord\\\\r\\\\nMilton's travels, we read of some North American Indians who were\\\\r\\\\nincapable of understanding the white man's difficulty in keeping a\\\\r\\\\nstraight line; but no man who has not had practice can walk through trees\\\\r\\\\nin a straight line, even with the utmost circumspection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter making several experiments, I think the explanation of the\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty and the way of overcoming it are as follows:--If a man walks\\\\r\\\\non a level surface, guided by a single conspicuous mark, he is almost\\\\r\\\\nsure not to travel towards it in a straight line; his muscular sense is\\\\r\\\\nnot delicate enough to guard him from making small deviations. If,\\\\r\\\\ntherefore, after walking some hundred yards towards a single mark, on\\\\r\\\\nground that preserves his track, the traveller should turn round, he will\\\\r\\\\nprobably be astonished to see how sinuous his course has been. However,\\\\r\\\\nif he take note of a second mark and endeavour to keep it strictly in a\\\\r\\\\nline with the first, he will easily keep a perfectly straight course. But\\\\r\\\\nif he cannot find a second mark, it will not be difficult for him to use\\\\r\\\\nthe tufts of grass, the stones, or the other accidents of the soil, in\\\\r\\\\nits place; they need not be precisely in the same line with the mark, but\\\\r\\\\nsome may be on the right and some on the left of it, in which case, as he\\\\r\\\\nwalks on the perspective of their change of position will be symmetrical.\\\\r\\\\nLastly, if he has not even one definite mark, but is walking among a\\\\r\\\\nthrong of forest trees, he may learn to depend wholly on the symmetry of\\\\r\\\\nthe changes of perspective of the trees as a guide to his path. He will\\\\r\\\\nkeep his point of sight unchanged and will walk in its direction, and if\\\\r\\\\nhe deviates from that direction, the want of symmetry in the change of\\\\r\\\\nperspective on either side of the point on which he wishes to walk, will\\\\r\\\\nwarn him of his error. The appreciation of this optical effect grows\\\\r\\\\neasily into a habit. When the more distant view happens to be shut out,\\\\r\\\\nthe traveller must regain his line under guidance similar to that by\\\\r\\\\nwhich a sailor steers who only looks at his compass at intervals--I mean\\\\r\\\\nby the aspect of the sky, the direction of the wind, and the appearance\\\\r\\\\nof the forest, when it has any peculiarity of growth dependent on\\\\r\\\\ndirection. The chance of his judgment being erroneous to a small extent\\\\r\\\\nis the same on the right hand as on the left, consequently his errors\\\\r\\\\ntend to compensate each other. I wish some scientific traveller would\\\\r\\\\nrigidly test the powers of good bushmen and find their \\\\\\\"probable\\\\\\\" angular\\\\r\\\\ndeviation from the true course under different circumstances. Their line\\\\r\\\\nshould be given to them, and they should be told to make smokes at\\\\r\\\\nintervals. The position of these smokes could be easily mapped out by the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe art of walking in a straight line is possessed in an eminent degree\\\\r\\\\nby good ploughmen. They always look ahead, and let the plough take care\\\\r\\\\nof itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo find the way down a Hill-side.--If on arriving at the steep edge of a\\\\r\\\\nridge, you have to take the caravan down into the plain, and it appears\\\\r\\\\nthat a difficulty may arise in finding a good way for it; descend first\\\\r\\\\nyourself, as well as you can, and seek for a road as you climb back\\\\r\\\\nagain. It is far more easy to succeed in doing this as you ascend, than\\\\r\\\\nas you descend: because when at the bottom of a hill, its bold bluffs and\\\\r\\\\nprecipices face you, and you can at once see and avoid them: whereas at\\\\r\\\\nthe top, these are precisely the parts that you overlook and cannot see.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlind Paths.--Faintly-marked paths over grass (blind paths) are best seen\\\\r\\\\nfrom a distance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLost in a Fog.--Napoleon, when riding with his staff across a shallow arm\\\\r\\\\nof the Gulf of Suez, was caught in a fog: he utterly lost his way, and\\\\r\\\\nfound himself in danger. He there-upon ordered his staff to ride from\\\\r\\\\nhim, in radiating lines, in all directions, and that such of them as\\\\r\\\\nshould find the water to become more shallow, should shout out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMirage.--When it is excessive, it is most bewildering: a man will often\\\\r\\\\nmistake a tuft of grass, or a tree, or other most dissimilar object, for\\\\r\\\\nhis companion, or his horse, or game. An old traveller is rarely deceived\\\\r\\\\nby mirage. If he doubts, he can in many cases adopt the following hint\\\\r\\\\ngiven by Dr. Kane: \\\\\\\"Refraction will baffle a novice, on the ice; but we\\\\r\\\\nhave learned to baffle refraction. By sighting the suspected object with\\\\r\\\\nyour rifle at rest, you soon detect motion.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLost Path.--If you fairly lose your way in the dark, do not go on\\\\r\\\\nblundering hither and thither till you are exhausted; but make as\\\\r\\\\ncomfortable bivouac as you can, and start at daybreak fresh on your\\\\r\\\\nsearch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe bank of a watercourse, which is the best of clues, affords the worst\\\\r\\\\nof paths, and is quite unfit to be followed at night. The ground is\\\\r\\\\nalways more broken in the neighbourhood of a river than far away from it;\\\\r\\\\nand the vegatation is more tangled. Explorers travel most easily by\\\\r\\\\nkeeping far away from the banks of streams; because then they have fewer\\\\r\\\\nbroad tributaries and deep ravines to cross.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf in the daytime you find that you have quite lost your way, set\\\\r\\\\nsystematically to work to find it. At all event, do not make the matter\\\\r\\\\ndoubly perplexing by wandering further. Mark the place very distinctly\\\\r\\\\nwhere you discover yourself at fault, that it may be the centre of your\\\\r\\\\nsearch. Be careful to ride in such places as will preserve your tracks.\\\\r\\\\nBreak twigs if you are lost in a woodland: if in the open country, drag a\\\\r\\\\nstick to make a clear trail. Marks scratched on the ground to tell the\\\\r\\\\nhour and day that you passed by, will guide a relieving party. A great\\\\r\\\\nsmoke is useful for the same purpose and is visible for a long distance.\\\\r\\\\n(See \\\\\\\"Signals.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA man who loses himself, especially in a desert, is sadly apt to find his\\\\r\\\\npresence of mind forsake him, the sense of desolation is so strange and\\\\r\\\\noverpowering; but he may console himself with the statistics of his\\\\r\\\\nchance of safety--viz., that travellers, though constantly losing their\\\\r\\\\nparty, have hardly ever been known to perish unrelieved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen the lost traveller is dead beat with fatigue, let him exert a strong\\\\r\\\\ncontrol over himself, for if he gives way to terror, and wanders wildly\\\\r\\\\nabout hither and thither, he will do no good and exhaust his vital powers\\\\r\\\\nmuch sooner. He should erect some signal--as conspicuous a one as he\\\\r\\\\ncan--with something fluttering upon it, sit down in the shade, and,\\\\r\\\\nlistening keenly for any sound of succour, bear his fate like a man. His\\\\r\\\\nultimate safety is merely a question of time, for he is sure to be\\\\r\\\\nsearched for; and, if he can keep alive for two or three days, he will,\\\\r\\\\nin all probability, be found and saved. (To relieve thirst, p. 223;\\\\r\\\\nhunger, p. 197)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTheory.--When you discover you are lost, ask yourself the following three\\\\r\\\\nquestions: they comprise the ABC of the art of pathfinding, and I will\\\\r\\\\ntherefore distinguish them by the letters A, B, and C respectively:--A.\\\\r\\\\nWhat is the least distance that I can with certainty specify, within\\\\r\\\\nwhich the caravan-path, the river, or the sea-shore, that I wish to\\\\r\\\\nregain, lies? B. What is the direction, in a vague general way, towards\\\\r\\\\nwhich the path or river runs, or the sea-coast tends? C. When I last left\\\\r\\\\nthe path, did I turn to the left or to the right.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs regards A, calculate coolly how long you have been riding or walking,\\\\r\\\\nand at what pace, since you left your party; subtract for stoppages and\\\\r\\\\nwell-recollected zigzags; allow a mile and a half per hour for the pace\\\\r\\\\nwhen you have been loitering on foot, and three and a half when you have\\\\r\\\\nbeen walking fast. Bear in mind that occasional running makes an almost\\\\r\\\\ninappreciable difference; and that a man is always much nearer to the\\\\r\\\\nlost path, than he is inclined to fear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs regards B, if the man knows the course of the path to within eight\\\\r\\\\npoints of the compass (or one-fourth of the whole horizon), it is a great\\\\r\\\\ngain; or even if he knows B to within twelve points, say 120 degrees, or\\\\r\\\\none-third of the whole horizon, his knowledge is available. For instance,\\\\r\\\\nlet us suppose a man's general idea of the run of the path to be, that it\\\\r\\\\ngoes in a northerly and southerly direction: then if he is also positive\\\\r\\\\nthat the path does not deviate more than to the N.E. on the one side of\\\\r\\\\nthat direction, or to the N.W. on the other, he knows the direction to\\\\r\\\\nwithin eight points. Similarly he is sure to twelve points, if his\\\\r\\\\nlimits, on either hand, are E.N.E. and W.N.W. respectively.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nC requires no further explanation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, if a man can answer all three questions, A, B, to within eight\\\\r\\\\npoints of the compass, and C, he is four and a half times as well off as\\\\r\\\\nif he could only answer A; as will be seen by the following\\\\r\\\\nconsiderations. A knowledge of B in addition to A, is of only one-third\\\\r\\\\nthe use that it would be if C also were known.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1. Let P (fig. 1) be the point where the traveller finds himself at\\\\r\\\\nfault, and let P D to be a distance within which the path certainly lies;\\\\r\\\\nthen the circle, E D F, somewhere cuts the path, and the traveller\\\\r\\\\nstarting from P must first go to D, and then make the entire circuit, D E\\\\r\\\\nH F D, before he has exhausted his search. This distance of P D + D E H F\\\\r\\\\nD = P D + 6 P D nearly, = 7 P D altogether, which gives the length of\\\\r\\\\nroad that the man must be prepared to travel over who can answer no other\\\\r\\\\nthan the question A. Of course, P D may cut the path, but I am speaking\\\\r\\\\nof the extreme distance which the lost man may have to travel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch as described above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSupposing that question B can be answered as well as question A, an that\\\\r\\\\nthe direction of the line of road lies certainly within the points of the\\\\r\\\\ncompass, P S and P R. Draw the circumscribing parallelogram, G L H E M,\\\\r\\\\nwhose sides are respectively parallel to P S and P R. Join L M. By the\\\\r\\\\nconditions of this problem, the path must somewhere cut the circle E D F;\\\\r\\\\nand since L M cuts L H, which is a tangent to it, it is clear it must cut\\\\r\\\\nevery path--such as a a, parallel to L H, or to P R--that cuts the\\\\r\\\\ncircle. Similarly, the same line, L M, must cut every path parallel to P\\\\r\\\\nS, such as b b. Now if L M cuts every path that is parallel to either of\\\\r\\\\nthe extreme directions, P R or P S, it is obvious that it must also cut\\\\r\\\\nevery path that is parallel to an intermediate direction, such as c c,\\\\r\\\\nbut\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPL = PH/cos HPL = PD/cos 1/2 RPS;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe consequence of which is that P L exceeds P D by one-sixth, one-half\\\\r\\\\nas much again, or twice as much again, according as R P S = 60 degrees,\\\\r\\\\n90 degrees degrees, or 140 degrees.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe traveller who can only answer the questions A and B, but not C, must\\\\r\\\\nbe prepared to travel from P to L, and back again through P to M, a\\\\r\\\\ndistance equal to 3 P L. If, however, he can answer the question C, he\\\\r\\\\nknows at once whether to travel towards L or towards M, and he has no\\\\r\\\\nreturn journey to fear. At the worst, he has simply to travel the\\\\r\\\\ndistance P L.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe probable distance, as distinguished from the utmost possible distance\\\\r\\\\nthat a man may have to travel in the three cases, can be calculated\\\\r\\\\nmathematically. It would be out of place here to give the working of the\\\\r\\\\nlittle problem, but I append the rough numerical results in a table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Table as referred to above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe epitome of the whole is this:--1. If you can only answer the question\\\\r\\\\nA, you must seek for the lost path by the tedious circle plan; or, what\\\\r\\\\nis the same, and a more manageable way of setting to work, by travelling\\\\r\\\\nin an octagon, each side of which must be equal to four-fifths of P D.\\\\r\\\\n(See fig. 2.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Fig. 2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat is to say, look at your compass and start in any direction you\\\\r\\\\nplease; we will say to the south, as represented in the drawing. Travel\\\\r\\\\nfor a distance, P D; then supposing you have not crossed the path, turn\\\\r\\\\nat right angles, and start afresh--we will suppose your present\\\\r\\\\ndirection to be west--travel for a distance 4/10 of P D, which will take\\\\r\\\\nyou to 1; then turn to the N.W. and travel for a distance 8/10 of P D,\\\\r\\\\nwhich will take you to 2; then to the N. for a similar distance, which\\\\r\\\\nwill take you to 3; and so on, till the octagon has been completed. If\\\\r\\\\nyou know B to eight points, and not C, adopt the L M system; also, if you\\\\r\\\\nknow A and C, and B to within thirteen points (out of the sixteen that\\\\r\\\\nform the semicircle), you may still adopt the L M system; but not\\\\r\\\\notherwise. A rough diagram scratched on the ground with a stick would\\\\r\\\\nsuffice to recall the above remarks to a traveller's recollection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCACHES AND DEPOTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCaches.--It is easy enough to choose a spot, which you yourself shall\\\\r\\\\nagain recognise, for digging a hole, where stores of all kinds may be\\\\r\\\\nburied against your return: neither is it difficult to choose one, so\\\\r\\\\nthat you may indicate its position to others, or else leave it to a party\\\\r\\\\nwho are travelling in concert, to find it out for themselves. But\\\\r\\\\nexcessive caution in the mode of depositing the stores is, in every case,\\\\r\\\\nrequired, as hungry and thieving natives keep watch on all the movements\\\\r\\\\nof a party; they follow their tracks and hunt over their old\\\\r\\\\ncamping-places, in search of anything there may be to pick up. And\\\\r\\\\nhyenas, wolves, wild dogs, and all kinds of prowling animals, guided by\\\\r\\\\ntheir sharp scent, will soon scratch up any provisions that are buried\\\\r\\\\ncarelessly, or in such a way as to taint the earth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe natives in Ceylon, when they wish to make a depot of game, jerk it,\\\\r\\\\nput the dry meat into the hollow of a tree, fill up the reservoir with\\\\r\\\\nhoney, and plaster it over with clay.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSome dried plants of M. Bourgeau, the botanist attached to Captain\\\\r\\\\nPalliser's expedition to the Rocky Mountains, remained underground for\\\\r\\\\nten months without injury.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNewly disturbed Ground sinks when Wetted.--If a cache be made in dry\\\\r\\\\nweather, and the ground be simply levelled over it, the first heavy rain\\\\r\\\\nwill cause the earth to sink, and will proclaim the hidden store to an\\\\r\\\\nobservant eye. Soldiers, in sacking a town, find out hastily-buried\\\\r\\\\ntreasures by throwing a pailful of water over any suspected spot: if the\\\\r\\\\nground sinks, it has surely been recently disturbed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBest place for a Cache.--The best position to choose for a cache is in a\\\\r\\\\nsandy or gravelly soil, on account of its dryness and the facility of\\\\r\\\\ndigging. Old burrows, or the gigantic but abandoned hills of white ants,\\\\r\\\\nmay be thought of, if the stores are enclosed in cases of painted tin:\\\\r\\\\nalso clefts in rocks: some things can be conveniently buried under water.\\\\r\\\\nThe place must be chosen under circumstances that admit of your effacing\\\\r\\\\nall signs of the ground having been disturbed. A good plan is to set up\\\\r\\\\nyour tent and to dig a deep hole in the floor, depositing what you have\\\\r\\\\nto bury wrapped in an oil-cloth, in an earthen jar, or in a wooden\\\\r\\\\nvessel, according to what you are able to get. It must be secure against\\\\r\\\\nthe attacks of the insects of the place: avoid the use of skins, for\\\\r\\\\nanimals will smell and dig them out. Continue to inhabit the tent for at\\\\r\\\\nleast a day, well stamping and smoothing down the soil at leisure. After\\\\r\\\\nthis, change the position of the tent, shifting the tethering-place or\\\\r\\\\nkraal of your cattle to where it stood. They will speedily efface any\\\\r\\\\nmarks that may be left. Travellers often make their fires over the holes\\\\r\\\\nwhere their stores are buried; but natives are so accustomed to suspect\\\\r\\\\nfireplaces, that this plan does not prove to be safe. During summer\\\\r\\\\ntravel, in countries pestered with gnats, a smoke fire for the horses\\\\r\\\\n(that is, a fire for keeping off flies), made near the place, will\\\\r\\\\nattract the horses and cause them to trample all about. This is an\\\\r\\\\nexcellent way of obliterating marks left about the cache.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHiding Small Things.--It is easy to make a small cache by bending down a\\\\r\\\\nyoung tree, tying your bundle to the top, and letting it spring up again.\\\\r\\\\nA spruce-tree gives excellent shelter to anything placed in its branches.\\\\r\\\\n(See also what is said on \\\\\\\"Burying Letters,\\\\\\\" p. 303.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHiding Large Things.--Large things, as a wagon or boat, must either be\\\\r\\\\npushed into thick bushes or reeds and left to chance, or they may be\\\\r\\\\nburied in a sand drift or in a sandy deposit by a river side. A small\\\\r\\\\nreedy island is a convenient place for such caches.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDouble Caches.--Some persons, when they know that their intentions are\\\\r\\\\nsuspected, make two caches: the one with a few things buried in it, and\\\\r\\\\nconcealed with little care; the other, containing those that are really\\\\r\\\\nvaluable, and very artfully made. Thieves are sure to discover the first,\\\\r\\\\nand are likely enough to omit a further search.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo find your Store again, you should have ascertained the distance and\\\\r\\\\nbearing, by compass, of the hole from some marked place--as a tree--about\\\\r\\\\nwhich you are sure not to be mistaken; or from the centre of the place\\\\r\\\\nwhere your fire was made, which is a mark that years will not entirely\\\\r\\\\nefface. If there be anything in the ground itself to indicate the\\\\r\\\\nposition of the hole, you have made a clumsy cache. It is not a bad plan,\\\\r\\\\nafter the things are buried, and before the tent is removed, to scratch a\\\\r\\\\nfurrow a couple of inches deep, and three or four feet long, and picking\\\\r\\\\nup any bits of stick, reeds, or straw, that may be found at hand lying\\\\r\\\\nupon the ground, to place them end to end in it. These will be easy\\\\r\\\\nenough to find again by making a cross furrow, and when found will lead\\\\r\\\\nyou straight above the depot. They would never excite suspicion, even if\\\\r\\\\na native got hold of them; for they would appear to have been dropped or\\\\r\\\\nblown on the ground by chance, not seen and trampled in. Mr. Atkinson\\\\r\\\\nmentions an ingenious way by which the boundaries of valuable mining\\\\r\\\\nproperty are marked in the Ural, a modification of which might serve for\\\\r\\\\nindicating caches. A trench is dug and filled with charcoal beat small,\\\\r\\\\nand then covered over. The charcoal lasts for ever, and cannot be\\\\r\\\\ntampered with without leaving an unmistakable mark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSecreting Jewels.--Before going to a rich but imperfectly civilised\\\\r\\\\ncountry, travellers sometimes buy jewels and bury them in their flesh.\\\\r\\\\nThey make a gash, put the jewels in, and allow the flesh to grow over\\\\r\\\\nthem as it would over a bullet. The operation is more sure to succeed if\\\\r\\\\nthe jewels are put into a silver tube with rounded ends, for silver does\\\\r\\\\nnot irritate. If the jewels are buried without the tube, they must have\\\\r\\\\nno sharp edges. The best place for burying them is in the left arm, at\\\\r\\\\nthe spot chosen for vaccination. A traveller who was thus provided would\\\\r\\\\nalways have a small capital to fall back upon, though robbed of\\\\r\\\\neverything he wore.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA Chain of gold is sometimes carried by Arabs, who sew it in dirty\\\\r\\\\nleather under their belt. They cut off and sell a link at a time.\\\\r\\\\n(Burton)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe gun-stock is a good receptacle for small valuables. Unscrew the\\\\r\\\\nheel-plate and bore recesses; insert what you desire, after wrapping it\\\\r\\\\ntightly in cloth and plugging it in; then replace the heel-plate. (Peal.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepositing Letters.--To direct Attention to the Place of Deposit.--When\\\\r\\\\nyou make a cache in an inhabited land, for the use of a travelling party\\\\r\\\\nwho are ignorant of your purpose, there is of course some difficulty in\\\\r\\\\nensuring that their attention should be directed to the place, but that\\\\r\\\\nthe natives should have no clue to it. If you have means of gashing,\\\\r\\\\npainting or burning characters, something of this sort (see fig.), they\\\\r\\\\nwill explain themselves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of direction plate].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSavages, however, take such pains to efface any mark they may find left\\\\r\\\\nby white men, entertaining thoughts like those of Morgiana in the\\\\r\\\\n'Arabian Nights' tale of the Forty Thieves, that it would be most\\\\r\\\\nimprudent to trust to a single mark. A relief party should therefore be\\\\r\\\\nprovided with a branding-iron and moveable letters, and with paints, and\\\\r\\\\nthey should mark the tree in many places. A couple of hours spent in\\\\r\\\\ndoing this would leave more marks than the desultory efforts of roving\\\\r\\\\nsavages would be likely to efface. A good sign to show that Europeans\\\\r\\\\nhave visited a spot is a saw mark (no savages use saws): it catches the\\\\r\\\\neye directly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA system occasionally employed by Arctic expeditions, of making a cache\\\\r\\\\n10 feet true north (and not magnetic north) from the cairn or mark,\\\\r\\\\ndeserves to be generally employed, at least with modifications. Let me\\\\r\\\\ntherefore suggest, that persons who find a cairn built of a tree marked,\\\\r\\\\nso as to attract notice, and who are searching blindly in all directions\\\\r\\\\nfor further clue, should invariably dig out and examine that particular\\\\r\\\\nspot. The notice deposited there may consist of no more than a single\\\\r\\\\nsentence, to indicate some distant point as the place where the longer\\\\r\\\\nletter is buried. I hope it will be understood, that the precaution of\\\\r\\\\nalways burying a notice 10 feet true north of the cairn mark is proposed\\\\r\\\\nas additional to and not in the place of other contrivances for giving\\\\r\\\\ninformation. There will often arise some doubt as to the exact point in\\\\r\\\\nthe circumference of the cairn or mark whence the 10 feet measurement\\\\r\\\\nshould be made. This is due to the irregularity of the bases of all such\\\\r\\\\nmarks. Therefore, when searching for letters, a short trench, running to\\\\r\\\\nthe north, will frequently have to be dug, and not a mere hole. I should\\\\r\\\\npropose that the short notice be punched or pricked on a thin sheet of\\\\r\\\\nlead, made by pouring two or three melted bullets on a flat stone, and\\\\r\\\\nthat the plate so made and inscribed should be rolled up and pushed into\\\\r\\\\na hole bored or burnt through the head of a large tent peg. The peg could\\\\r\\\\nbe driven deeply in the ground, quite out of sight, without disturbing\\\\r\\\\nthe surrounding earth. It might even suffice to pick up a common stone\\\\r\\\\nand to scratch or paint upon it what you had to say, and to leave it on\\\\r\\\\nthe ground, with its written face downwards, at the place in question.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo secure Buried Letters from Damp.--They may be wrapped in waxed cloth\\\\r\\\\nor paper, if there be no fear of the ravages of insects. Lead plate is\\\\r\\\\nfar more safe: it can be made easily enough by a traveller out of his\\\\r\\\\nbullets. (See \\\\\\\"Lead.\\\\\\\") A glass bottle (with something that insects cannot\\\\r\\\\neat, such as lead-plate, sealing-wax or clay, put carefully over the\\\\r\\\\ncork) or an earthen jar may be used. The quill of a large feather will\\\\r\\\\nhold a long letter, if it is written in very small handwriting and on\\\\r\\\\nthin paper, and it will preserve it from the wet. After the letter has\\\\r\\\\nbeen rolled up and inserted in the quill, the open end of the latter may\\\\r\\\\nbe squeezed flat between two stones, heated sufficiently to soften the\\\\r\\\\nquill (see \\\\\\\"Horn\\\\\\\") but not so hot as to burn it, and then, for greater\\\\r\\\\nsecurity against wet, the end of the quill should be twisted tight. Wax\\\\r\\\\naffords another easy means of closing the quill.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPicture-writing.--A very many excellent bushrangers are unable to read,\\\\r\\\\nrude picture-writing is often used by them, especialy in America. The\\\\r\\\\nfigure of a man with a spear or bow, drawn as a child would draw, stands\\\\r\\\\nfor a savage; one with a hat or gun for a European; horses, oxen, and\\\\r\\\\nsheep are equally to be drawn; lines represent numbers, and arrow-heads\\\\r\\\\ndirection. Even without more conventional symbols, a vast deal may be\\\\r\\\\nexpressed by rude picture-writing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReconnoitring Barren Countries by help of Porters and Caches.--The\\\\r\\\\ndistance to which an explorer can attain in barren countries depends on\\\\r\\\\nthe number of days' provisions that he can carry with him. Half of his\\\\r\\\\nload supports him on his way out, the other half on his way home. But if\\\\r\\\\nhe start in company with a laden porter, he may reserve his own store and\\\\r\\\\nsupply both himself and the porter from the pack carried by the latter.\\\\r\\\\nWhen half of this is consumed, the other half may be divided into two\\\\r\\\\nequal portions. The one is retained by the porter who makes his way back\\\\r\\\\nto camp, consuming it as he goes, and the other is cached (see \\\\\\\"Caches\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\nfor the sustenance of the traveller on his return journey. This being\\\\r\\\\narranged, the traveller can start from the cache with his own load of\\\\r\\\\nprovisions untouched, just as he would have started from the camp if he\\\\r\\\\nhad had no porter to assist him. It is evident a process of this\\\\r\\\\ndescription might be frequently repeated; that a large party of porters\\\\r\\\\nmight start, and by a system of successive subdivisions, they could\\\\r\\\\nenable the traveller to reach a position many days' journey distant from\\\\r\\\\nhis camp, with his own load of provisions and with other food placed in a\\\\r\\\\nsuccession of caches, for the supply of his wants all the way home again.\\\\r\\\\nThe principle by which this may be effected without waste, is to send\\\\r\\\\nback at each successive step the smallest detachment competent to travel\\\\r\\\\nalone, and to do this as soon as one half of their load of food has been\\\\r\\\\nconsumed by the whole party. Then, the other half is to be divided into\\\\r\\\\ntwo portions; one consisting of rations to supply the detachment back to\\\\r\\\\nthe previous cache, whence their journey home has been provided for, the\\\\r\\\\nother portion to be buried, to supply rations for the remainder of the\\\\r\\\\nparty, when they shall have returned (either all together or else in\\\\r\\\\nseparate and successive detachments) back to the previous cache, whence\\\\r\\\\ntheir journey home has also been provided for. An inspection of the Table\\\\r\\\\nwhich I annex (p. 307) makes details unnecessary. The dotted lines show\\\\r\\\\nhow the porters who first return may be dispatched afresh as relief\\\\r\\\\nparties. I give, in the table, a schedule of the three most important\\\\r\\\\ncases. In these the regular supply of two meals per diem, and a morning\\\\r\\\\nand an afternoon journey, are supposed. I wrote a paper on this subject,\\\\r\\\\nwhich is published in the 'Royal Geographical Society's Proceedings,'\\\\r\\\\nvol. ii., to which I refer those who care to inquire further into the\\\\r\\\\nmatter. Cases where each man or horse carries a number of rations\\\\r\\\\nintermediate to those specified in the Table, are, perhaps, too\\\\r\\\\ncomplicated for use without much previous practice. It would be easy for\\\\r\\\\na leader to satisfy himself that he was making no mistake, and to drill\\\\r\\\\nhis men to any one of the tabulated cases, by painting a row of sticks,\\\\r\\\\n50 yards apart, to represent the successive halting-places of his\\\\r\\\\nintended journey, and by making his men go through a sham rehearsal of\\\\r\\\\nwhat they would severally have to do. Then each man's duties could be\\\\r\\\\nwritten down in a schedule and all possibility of mistake be avoided.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Table represents the proceedings of four men (or horses and men), who\\\\r\\\\nleave camp. Two turn back at P1, one more turns back at P2, and the\\\\r\\\\nremaining man pushes on to P3. Food has been cached for him both at P2\\\\r\\\\nand P1; but to make matters doubly sure, a relief party, as shown by the\\\\r\\\\ndotted line, can be sent to meet him at P2.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn Case A, each man             carries 1 1/2 day's rations.\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\\\\"    B.      \\\\\\\"   (or horse)    \\\\\\\"     3 1/2 days' rations for\\\\r\\\\n                                         himself (and drivers).\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\\\\"    C. each man (or horse)  carries 5 1/2 days' rations for\\\\r\\\\n                                         himself (and drivers).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe will take the case C as an example. The figures that refer to it are\\\\r\\\\nin the lines adjacent to the letter C in the Table. They are those in the\\\\r\\\\nuppermost line, and also those in the line up the left-hand side of the\\\\r\\\\ndiagram, and they stand for days' journey and for days respectively. P1\\\\r\\\\nis reached after 1 1/2 day's travel, P2 after 3 days, P3 after 6 days\\\\r\\\\nfrom camp. The entire party might consist of 5 men, 2 carts (one a very\\\\r\\\\nlight one), and four horses, together with one saddle and bridle. The\\\\r\\\\nheavier cart and 2 men and 2 horses would turn back at P1. One of the two\\\\r\\\\nhorses of the second cart would be saddled and ridden back by a third man\\\\r\\\\nfrom P2; and, finally, the remaining cart, single horse, and 2 men, would\\\\r\\\\nturn back, after 6 days, from P3.--The relief party would\\\\r\\\\noriginallyconsist of the first cart and 3 horses. On arriving at P1, a\\\\r\\\\nhorse and man would be sent back. At P2 it would have more than enough\\\\r\\\\nspare rations to admit of its waiting two whole days for the exploring\\\\r\\\\ncart, if it were necessary to do so.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Full page diagram as described above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt will be seen from the Table that as 6 days' journey is the limit to\\\\r\\\\nwhich C can explore, so 4 days' journey is the limit for B, and 2 days\\\\r\\\\nfor A. But where abundance of provision is secured at P2 by means of a\\\\r\\\\nrelief party, the explorers might well make an effort and travel on half\\\\r\\\\nrations to a greater distance than the limits here assigned.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMANAGEMENT OF SAVAGES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--A frank, joking, but determined manner, joined with an\\\\r\\\\nair of showing more confidence in the good faith of the natives than you\\\\r\\\\nreally feel, is the best. It is observed, that a sea-captain generally\\\\r\\\\nsucceeds in making an excellent impression on savages: they thoroughly\\\\r\\\\nappreciate common sense, truth, and uprightness; and are not half such\\\\r\\\\nfools as strangers usually account them. If a savage does mischief, look\\\\r\\\\non him as you would on a kicking mule, or a wild animal, whose nature is\\\\r\\\\nto be unruly and vicious, and keep your temper quite unruffled. Evade the\\\\r\\\\nmischief, if you can: if you cannot, endure it; and do not trouble\\\\r\\\\nyourself overmuch about your dignity, or about retaliating on the man,\\\\r\\\\nexcept it be on the grounds of expediency. There are even times when any\\\\r\\\\nassumption of dignity becomes ludicrous, and the traveller must, as Mungo\\\\r\\\\nPark had once to do, \\\\\\\"lay it down as a rule to make himself as useless\\\\r\\\\nand as insignificant as possible, as the only means of recovering his\\\\r\\\\nliberty.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBush Law.--It is impossible but that a traveller must often take the law\\\\r\\\\ninto his own hands. Some countries, no doubt, are governed with a strong\\\\r\\\\narm by a savage despot; to whom or to whose subordinates appeals must of\\\\r\\\\ncourse be made; but, for the most part, the system of life among savages\\\\r\\\\nis--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"The simple rule, the good old plan--\\\\r\\\\nThat they should take, who have the power;\\\\r\\\\nAnd they should keep, who can.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhere there is no civil law, or any kind of substitute for it, each man\\\\r\\\\nis, as it were, a nation in himself; and then the traveller ought to be\\\\r\\\\nguided in his actions by the motives that influence nations, whether to\\\\r\\\\nmake war or to abstain from it, rather than by the criminal code of\\\\r\\\\ncivilised countries. The traveller must settle in his own mind what his\\\\r\\\\nscale of punishments should be; and it will be found a convenient\\\\r\\\\nprinciple that a culprit should be punished in proportion to the quantity\\\\r\\\\nof harm that he has done, rather than according to the presumed\\\\r\\\\nwickedness of the offence. Thus, if two men were caught, one of whom had\\\\r\\\\nstolen an ox, and the other a sheep, it would be best to flog the first\\\\r\\\\nmuch more heavily than the second; it is a measure of punishment more\\\\r\\\\nintelligible to savages than ours. The principle of double or treble\\\\r\\\\nrestitution, to which they are well used, is of the same nature. If all\\\\r\\\\ntheft be punished, your administration will be a reign of terror; for\\\\r\\\\nevery savage, even your best friends, will pilfer little things from you,\\\\r\\\\nwhenever they have a good opportunity. Be very severe if any of your own\\\\r\\\\nparty steal trifles from natives: order double or treble restitution, if\\\\r\\\\nthe man does not know better; and, if he does, a flogging besides, and\\\\r\\\\nnot in place of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeizing Food.--On arriving at an encampment, the natives commonly run\\\\r\\\\naway in fright. If you are hungry, or in serious need of anything that\\\\r\\\\nthey have, go boldly into their huts, take just what you want, and leave\\\\r\\\\nfully adequate payment. It is absurd to be over-scrupulous in these\\\\r\\\\ncases.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFeast-Days.--Interrupt the monotony of travel, by marked days, on which\\\\r\\\\nyou give extra tobacco and sugar to the servants. Avoid constant good\\\\r\\\\nfeeding, but rather have frequent slight fasts to ensure occasional good\\\\r\\\\nfeasts; and let those occasions when marked stages of your journey have\\\\r\\\\nbeen reached, be great gala-days. Recollect that a savage cannot endure\\\\r\\\\nthe steady labour that we Anglo-Saxons have been bred to support. His\\\\r\\\\nnature is adapted to alternations of laziness and of severe exertion.\\\\r\\\\nPromote merriment, singing, fiddling, and so forth, with all your power.\\\\r\\\\nAutolycus says, in 'A Winter's Tale'--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,\\\\r\\\\nMerrily bent the stils-a:\\\\r\\\\nA merry heart goes all the day,\\\\r\\\\nYour sad tires in a mile-a.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlogging.--Different tribes have very different customs in the matter of\\\\r\\\\ncorporal punishment: there are some who fancy it a disgrace and a serious\\\\r\\\\ninsult. A young traveller must therefore be discriminating and cautious\\\\r\\\\nin the licence he allows to his stick, or he may fall into sad trouble.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKindliness of Women--Wherever you go, you will find kindheartedness\\\\r\\\\namongst women. Mungo Park is fond of recording his experiences of this;\\\\r\\\\nbut I must add that he seems to have been an especial favourite with the\\\\r\\\\nsex. The gentler of the two sexes is a \\\\\\\"teterrima causa belli.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen you wish a Savage to keep count, give him a string of beads. The\\\\r\\\\nboxes and parcels that are sent by the overland route are, or were,\\\\r\\\\ncounted in this way by an Arab overseer. He was described as having a\\\\r\\\\ncord with great beads strung on it, and the end of the cord was thrown\\\\r\\\\nover his shoulder. As each box passed him, he jerked a bead from the fore\\\\r\\\\npart of the cord to the back part of it, over his shoulder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrawing Lots.--It is often necessary to distribute things by lot. Do it\\\\r\\\\nby what children call \\\\\\\"soldiering:\\\\\\\" One stands with his back to the rest'\\\\r\\\\nanother, pointing to the portions in succession, calls out \\\\\\\"Who is to\\\\r\\\\nhave this?\\\\\\\" To which the first one replies by naming somebody, who at\\\\r\\\\nonce takes possession.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOSTILITIES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Fortify a Camp.--Forts at opposite Corners.--Explorers have frequent\\\\r\\\\noccasion to form a depot: either a few men are left in charge of the\\\\r\\\\nheavy luggage, while the rest of the party ride on a distant\\\\r\\\\nreconnoitring expedition; or else the whole party may encamp for weeks,\\\\r\\\\nuntil the state of the season, or other cause, permits further travel. In\\\\r\\\\neither case, a little forethought and labour will vastly increase the\\\\r\\\\nsecurity of the depot against hostile attempts. For instance, it should\\\\r\\\\nbe placed at least 200 yards from any cover, or commanding heights; if\\\\r\\\\nthe ground on which it stands have any features of strength about it, as\\\\r\\\\nbeing near the side of a stream, or being on a hill, so much the better;\\\\r\\\\nthe neighbourhood of shingle prevents persons from stealing across\\\\r\\\\nunheard; and, finally, the camp should be fortified. Now the principle of\\\\r\\\\nfortification best suited to a small party, is to form the camp into a\\\\r\\\\nsquare, and to have two projecting enclosures at opposite corners, where\\\\r\\\\nall the men who have guns may place themselves to fire on the assailants.\\\\r\\\\nIt will be seen by the sketch, how completely the guns in each enclosure\\\\r\\\\ncan sweep the edges as well as the whole of the environs of the camp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of camp with fortifications].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA square is better than a round for the projecting enclosures, as it\\\\r\\\\nallows more men to use their guns at the same time on the same point; but\\\\r\\\\nit is so convenient to make the walls of the enclosure serve as sidings\\\\r\\\\nfor the tents, that it is perhaps best to allow the size and shape of the\\\\r\\\\ntent to determine those of the enclosures. A square of nine or ten feet,\\\\r\\\\ninside measurement, is amply sufficient for three guns or archers. The\\\\r\\\\nparapets can be built of large stones. A travelling party rarely carries\\\\r\\\\nspades, but when they have them, the parapet may be formed of the earth\\\\r\\\\nthrown up by digging a trench outside it; the common calculation is,\\\\r\\\\nthat, with good tools, a labourer can dig one cubic yard of earth an\\\\r\\\\nhour, and can continue working for eight hours in the day. The parapet\\\\r\\\\nshould be raised four feet above the ground, as that is the most\\\\r\\\\nconvenient height to fire from when standing; and it is high enough to\\\\r\\\\nshield a person kneeling down to load. Upon this parapet, large stones\\\\r\\\\nshould be laid, having loop-holes between them, and above the stones the\\\\r\\\\ntent may be pitched; its pole being lengthened by lashing apiece of wood\\\\r\\\\nto it, or by cutting a fresh pole altogether. It will make a high roof to\\\\r\\\\nthe enclosure, and will complete a comfortable abode. We have thus a\\\\r\\\\nsquare enclosed camp for the cattle, the wagons, and the natives of the\\\\r\\\\nparty; and, at opposite corners of it, two fortified houses: one of which\\\\r\\\\nwould naturally be inhabited by the leaders of the party; and the other,\\\\r\\\\neither by the storekeeper, or by the white servants generally\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTrous de Loup are holes, with sharp stake driven in the bottom of each of\\\\r\\\\nthem (see \\\\\\\"Pitfalls,\\\\\\\" p. 264) with the pointed end upwards. The South Sea\\\\r\\\\nIslanders use them in multitudes to prevent the possibility of an enemy's\\\\r\\\\napproach at night, otherwise than along the narrow paths that lead to\\\\r\\\\ntheir villages: if a man deviates from a path, he is sure to stumble into\\\\r\\\\none of these contrivances, and to be lamed. The holes need not exceed one\\\\r\\\\nfoot in diameter; and the stake may be a stick no thicker than the little\\\\r\\\\nfinger, and yet it will suffice to maim an ill-shod man, if its point be\\\\r\\\\nbaked hard. A traveller could only use these pitfalls where, from the\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances of the case, there was no risk of his own men, cattle, or\\\\r\\\\ndogs falling into them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWeapons, to resist an Attack.--Unless your ammunition is so kept as to be\\\\r\\\\naccessible in the confusion of an attack, the fortifications I have just\\\\r\\\\ndescribed would be of little service. If the guns are all, or nearly all,\\\\r\\\\nof the same bore, it is simple enough to have small bags filled with\\\\r\\\\ncartridges, and also papers with a dozen caps in each. Buck-shot and\\\\r\\\\nslugs are better than bullets, for the purposes of which we are speaking.\\\\r\\\\nBows and arrows might render good service. The Chinese, in their junks,\\\\r\\\\nwhen they expect a piratical attack, bring up baskets filled with stones\\\\r\\\\nfrom the ballast of the ship, and put them on deck ready at hand. They\\\\r\\\\nthrow them with great force and precision: the idea is not a bad one.\\\\r\\\\nBoiling water and hot sand, if circumstances happened to permit their\\\\r\\\\nuse, are worth bearing in mind, as they tell well on the bodies of naked\\\\r\\\\nassailants. In close quarters, thrust, do not strike; and recollect that\\\\r\\\\nit is not the slightest use to hit a negro on the head with a stick, as\\\\r\\\\nit is a fact that his skull endures a blow better than any other part of\\\\r\\\\nhis person. In picking out the chiefs, do not select the men that are the\\\\r\\\\nmost showily ornamented, for they are not the chiefs; but the biggest and\\\\r\\\\nthe busiest. A good horseman will find a powerful weapon at hand by\\\\r\\\\nunhitching his stirrup leather and attached stirrup from the saddle. I\\\\r\\\\nknow of a case where this idea saved the rider.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRockets.--Of all European inventions, nothing so impresses and terrifies\\\\r\\\\nsavages as fireworks, especially rockets. I cannot account for the\\\\r\\\\nremarkable effect they produce, but in every land, it appears to be the\\\\r\\\\nsame. A rocket, judiciously sent up, is very likely to frighten off an\\\\r\\\\nintended attack and save bloodshed. If a traveller is supplied with any\\\\r\\\\nof these, he should never make playthings of them, but keep them for\\\\r\\\\ngreat emergencies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNatives forbidden to throng the Camp.--Have a standing rule that many\\\\r\\\\nnatives should never be allowed to go inside your camp at the same time:\\\\r\\\\nfor it is everywhere a common practice among them, to collect quietly in\\\\r\\\\na friendly way, and at a signal to rise en masse and overpower their\\\\r\\\\nhosts. Even when they profess to have left their arms behind, do not be\\\\r\\\\ntoo confident: they are often deposited close at hand. Captain Sturt\\\\r\\\\nsays, that he has known Australian savages to trail their spears between\\\\r\\\\ntheir toes, as they lounged towards him through the grass, professedly\\\\r\\\\nunarmed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKeeping Watch.--Head near the ground.--When you think you hear anything\\\\r\\\\nastir, lie down and lay your ear on the ground. To see to the best\\\\r\\\\nadvantage, take the same position; you thus bring low objects in bold\\\\r\\\\nrelief against the sky. Besides this, in a wooded country, it is often\\\\r\\\\neasy to see far between the bare stems of the trees, while their\\\\r\\\\nspreading tops shut out all objects more than a few yards off. Thus, a\\\\r\\\\ndog or other small animal usually sees a man's legs long before he sees\\\\r\\\\nhis face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOpera-glass.--An opera-glass is an excellent night glass, and at least\\\\r\\\\ndoubles the clearness of vision in the dark (0p. 284).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEar-trunpet.--I should be glad to hear that a fair trial had been also\\\\r\\\\ngiven by a traveller to an ear-trumpet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWatchfulness of Cattle.--Cattle keep guard very well: a stranger can\\\\r\\\\nhardly approach a herd of oxen, without their finding him out; for\\\\r\\\\nseveral of them are always sure to be awake and watchful. The habits of\\\\r\\\\nbush life make a traveller, though otherwise sound asleep, start up\\\\r\\\\ndirectly at a very slight rustle of alarm among his cattle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOf Wild Birds and Beasts.--Scared birds and beasts often give\\\\r\\\\nuseful warning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmell of Negro.--A skulking negro may sometimes be smelt out like a fox.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDahoman Night-watch.--The Dahomans, the famous military nation of N.W.\\\\r\\\\nAfrica, have an odd method of dividing their watches by night, but \\\\\\\"which\\\\r\\\\nis generally managed very correctly. At each gate of a stockaded town, is\\\\r\\\\nposted a sentry, who is provided with a pile of stones, the exact number\\\\r\\\\nof which has been previously ascertained. The night is divided into four\\\\r\\\\nwatches; during each watch the sentry removes the pile of stones, one by\\\\r\\\\none, at a measured pace, from one gate to another, calling out at each\\\\r\\\\ntenth removal: when all are removed, the watch is relieved.\\\\\\\"--Forbes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSetting a common Gun as an Alarm-gun.--The gun may be loaded with bullet,\\\\r\\\\nor simply with powder, or only with a cap: even the click of the hammer\\\\r\\\\nmay suffice to awaken attention. For the ways of setting it, see p. 257.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrairie set on Fire.--This is often done as a means of offence. But when\\\\r\\\\nthe grass is short (lower than the knee), the strip of it on fire, at the\\\\r\\\\nsame moment, does not exceed 12 feet in width; therefore if a belt of\\\\r\\\\ngrass of 12 feet in width be destroyed in advance of the line of fire,\\\\r\\\\nthe conflagration will be arrested as soon as it reaches that belt. The\\\\r\\\\nfire will be incapable of traversing the interval narrow though it be,\\\\r\\\\nwhere there is a total absence of fuel to feed it. Travellers avail\\\\r\\\\nthemselves of this fact in a very happy manner, when a fire in the\\\\r\\\\nprairie is advancing towards them, by burning a strip of grass, to the\\\\r\\\\nwindward of their camp, of 12 feet in breadth; beating down the blaze\\\\r\\\\nwith their blankets wherever it would otherwise extend too widely. Behind\\\\r\\\\nthis easily constructed line of defence, the camp rests in security, and\\\\r\\\\nthe adjacent grass remains uninjured for the use of the cattle. If,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, the wind is high and sparks are drifted for some distance beyond\\\\r\\\\nthe belt of fire, this method is insufficient: two lines of defence\\\\r\\\\nshould then be constructed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTricks upon Robbers.--It is perhaps just worth while to mention a trick\\\\r\\\\nthat has been practised in most countries, from England to Peru. A\\\\r\\\\ntraveller is threatened by a robber with a gun, and ordered to throw\\\\r\\\\nhimself on the ground, or he will be fired at. The traveller taking a\\\\r\\\\npistol from his belt, shouts out, \\\\\\\"If this were loaded you should not\\\\r\\\\ntreat me thus!\\\\\\\" and throws himself on the ground as the robber bids him.\\\\r\\\\nThere he lies till the robber, in his triumph, comes up for his booty;\\\\r\\\\nwhen the intended victim takes a quick aim and shoots him dead--the\\\\r\\\\npistol being really loaded all the time. I have also heard of an incident\\\\r\\\\nin the days of Shooter's Hill, in England, where a ruffian waylaid and\\\\r\\\\nsprang upon a traveller, and holding a pistol to his breast, summoned him\\\\r\\\\nfor the contents of his pocket. The traveller dived his hand into one of\\\\r\\\\nthem, and, silently cocking a small pistol that lay in it, shot the\\\\r\\\\nrobber dead, firing out through the side of the pocket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPassing through a Hostile Country.--How to encamp.--A small party has\\\\r\\\\noften occasion to try to steal through a belt of hostile country without\\\\r\\\\nbeing observed. At such times, it is a rule never to encamp until long\\\\r\\\\nafter sun-down, in order that people on your track may be unable to\\\\r\\\\npursue it with ease. If you are pursuing a beaten path, turn sharp out of\\\\r\\\\nit, when you intend to encamp, selecting a place for doing so where the\\\\r\\\\nground is too hard to show footprints; then travel away for a quarter of\\\\r\\\\nan hour, at least. Lastly, look out for a hollow place, in the midst of\\\\r\\\\nan open flat. Never allow hammering of any kind in your camp, nor loud\\\\r\\\\ntalking; but there is no danger in lighting a small fire, if reasonable\\\\r\\\\nprecautions be taken, as a flame cannot be seen far through bushes. Keep\\\\r\\\\na strict watch all night: the watchers should be 100 yards out from camp,\\\\r\\\\nand should relieve one another, every two hours at least. Enough animals\\\\r\\\\nfor riding, one for each man, should always be tied up, in readiness for\\\\r\\\\ninstant use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen riding alone.--A person who is riding a journey for his life, sleeps\\\\r\\\\nmost safely with his horse's head tied short up to his wrist. The horse,\\\\r\\\\nif he hears anything, tosses his head and jerks the rider's arm. The\\\\r\\\\nhorse is a careful animal, and there appears to be little danger of his\\\\r\\\\ntreading on his sleeping master.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of horse tethered as above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Indians of South America habitually adopt this plan, when\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances require extreme caution (see fig.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo prevent your Horse from neighing.--If a troop of horsemen pass near\\\\r\\\\nyour hiding-place, it may be necessary to clutch your steed's muzzle with\\\\r\\\\nboth hands, to prevent his neighing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHurried retreat of a Party.--When a party, partly of horsemen and partly\\\\r\\\\nof footmen, are running away from danger as hard as they can, the footmen\\\\r\\\\nlay hold of the stirrup-leathers of the riders, to assist them. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Litters for the Wounded,\\\\\\\" p. 23.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSecuring Prisoners.--To take a strong man Prisoner singlehanded, threaten\\\\r\\\\nhim with your gun, and compel him to throw all his arms away; then,\\\\r\\\\nmarching him before you some little distance, make him lie flat on his\\\\r\\\\nface and put his hands behind him. Of course he will be in a dreadful\\\\r\\\\nfright, and require reassuring. Next take your knife, put it between your\\\\r\\\\nteeth, and, standing over him, take the caps off your gun, and lay it\\\\r\\\\ndown by your side. Then handcuff him, in whatever way you best can. The\\\\r\\\\nreason of setting to work in this way is, that a quick supple savage,\\\\r\\\\nwhile you are fumbling with your strings, and bothered with a loaded gun,\\\\r\\\\nmight easily spring round, seize hold of it, and quite turn the tables\\\\r\\\\nagainst you. But if the gun had no caps on, it would be of little use in\\\\r\\\\nhis hands, except as a club; and also, if you had a knife between your\\\\r\\\\nteeth, it would be impossible for him to free himself by struggling,\\\\r\\\\nwithout exposing himself to a thrust from it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCord to be well stretched.--It is an imperfect security to tie an\\\\r\\\\ningenious active man, whose hands and feet are small, unless the cord or\\\\r\\\\nwhatever else you may use, had been thoroughly well stretched. Many\\\\r\\\\npeople have exhibited themselves for money, who allowed themselves to be\\\\r\\\\ntied hand and foot and then to be put into a sack, whence they emerged\\\\r\\\\nafter a few minutes, with the cords in a neat coil in their hands. The\\\\r\\\\nbrothers Davenport were notorious for possessing this skill. They did not\\\\r\\\\nshow themselves for half-pence at country fairs; but, by implying that\\\\r\\\\nthey were set free by supranatural agencies, they held fashionable\\\\r\\\\nseances in London and created an immense sensation a few years ago. Two\\\\r\\\\nof these exhibitors were tied, face to face in a cupboard, respectively\\\\r\\\\nby two persons selected by the audience. The latter inspected one\\\\r\\\\nanother's knots as well as they could, and on their expressing themselves\\\\r\\\\nsatisfied, the doors of the cupboard were closed, the lights of the room\\\\r\\\\nwere kept low for 5 or 10 minutes, until a signal was made by the\\\\r\\\\nexhibitors from within the cupboard; then in a blaze of gas light the\\\\r\\\\ndoors were opened from within and out walked the two men, leaving the\\\\r\\\\nropes behind them. After this, they tied themselves in their own knots;\\\\r\\\\nand under those easy conditions a number of so-called spiritual\\\\r\\\\nmanifestations took place, which I need not here describe; the real\\\\r\\\\ncuriosity of the exhibition being that which I have just explained. These\\\\r\\\\nexhibitions continued for months; but at length two nautical gentlemen\\\\r\\\\ninsisted on using their own cord, which they had previously well\\\\r\\\\nstretched, and this proceeding utterly baffled the Davenports.\\\\r\\\\nThenceforward wherever the Davenports showed themselves, the nautical\\\\r\\\\ngentlemen appeared also, appealing to the audience to elect them to tie\\\\r\\\\nthe hands of the exhibitors. In this way, they fairly exposed the\\\\r\\\\npretensions of the Davenports, and drove them from England. Once I was\\\\r\\\\nproposed by an audience to tie the hands. I did my best, and I also\\\\r\\\\nscrutinised my colleague's knot, as well as the confined place in which\\\\r\\\\nthe exhibitors were tied, permitted. The cord we had to use was perhaps a\\\\r\\\\nlittle too thick, but it was supple and strong, and I was greatly\\\\r\\\\nsurprised at the ease with which the Davenports disembarrassed\\\\r\\\\nthemselves. They were not more than 10 minutes in getting free. Of course\\\\r\\\\nif either of the exhibitors could struggle loose, he would assist his\\\\r\\\\ncolleague. It therefore struck me as an exceedingly ingenious idea of the\\\\r\\\\nDavenports, to have two persons, and not one person, to tie them. I\\\\r\\\\nconsidered it was very improbable that a person taken at hap-hazard\\\\r\\\\nshould be capable of tying his man securely; and it was evident that the\\\\r\\\\nimprobability would be increased in a duplicate ratio, that both persons\\\\r\\\\nshould be capable. Thus if it be 20 to 1 against any one person's having\\\\r\\\\nsufficient skill, it is (20 by 20 or) 400 to 1 against both the persons,\\\\r\\\\nwho might be selected to tie the Davenports, being able to do so\\\\r\\\\neffectively. As I have already said, the opportunity that was afforded to\\\\r\\\\neach of scrutinising the work of the other, was worth very little,\\\\r\\\\nbecause of the dark and confined space in which the exhibitors sat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTying the Hands.--To tie a man's hands behind his back, take a\\\\r\\\\nhandkerchief, it is the best thing; failing that, a thin cord. It is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary that its length should not be less than 2 feet, but 2 feet 6\\\\r\\\\ninches is the right length; for a double tie, it should be 3 feet 6\\\\r\\\\ninches. Compel him to lay his hands as in the sketch, and, wrapping the\\\\r\\\\ncord once (or twice if it be long enough) round the arms, pretty tightly,\\\\r\\\\npass the longest end in between the arms as shown in the figure, and tie\\\\r\\\\nquite tightly. If you are quick in tying the common \\\\\\\"tom-fool's knot,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nwell known to every sailor, it is still better for the purpose. Put the\\\\r\\\\nprisoner's hands one within each loop, then draw tightly the running\\\\r\\\\nends, and knot them together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of hands tied as above].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTying the Thumbs.--To secure a prisoner with the least amount of string,\\\\r\\\\nplace his hands back to back, behind him, then tie the thumbs together,\\\\r\\\\nand also the little fingers. Two bits of thin string, each a foot long,\\\\r\\\\nwill thoroughly do this. But if you have not any string at hand, cut a\\\\r\\\\nthong from his leathern apron, or tear a strip from you own linen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of person with bound hands].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStrait-Waistcoats.--A strait-waistcoat is the least inconvenient mode of\\\\r\\\\nconfinement, as the joints of the prisoner are not cut by cords. A\\\\r\\\\nmakeshift for one is soon stitched together, by stitching a piece of\\\\r\\\\ncanvas into the shape of a sleeve, and sewing one end of this to one cuff\\\\r\\\\nof a strong jacket, and the other end to the other cuff; so that, instead\\\\r\\\\nof the jacket having two sleeves, it has but one long one. The jacket is\\\\r\\\\nthen put on in the usual way, and buttoned and sewn in front. In a proper\\\\r\\\\nstrait-waistcoat, the opening is behind and the sleeves in front; it\\\\r\\\\nlaces up behind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of man in waistcoat].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTying up a Prisoner for the night.--If a man has to be kept prisoner all\\\\r\\\\nnight, it is not sufficient to tie his hands, as he will be sure to watch\\\\r\\\\nhis time and run away. It is therefore necessary to tie them round a\\\\r\\\\nstanding tree, or a heavy log of wood. A convenient plan is to fell a\\\\r\\\\nlarge forked bough, and to make the man's arms fast round one of the\\\\r\\\\nbranches. It is thus impossible for him to slip away, as the fork on one\\\\r\\\\nside, and the bushy top of the branch on the other, prevent his doing so;\\\\r\\\\nand, notwithstanding his cramped position, it is quite possible for him\\\\r\\\\nto get sleep.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFiles of Prisoners.--When several men have to be made fast and marched\\\\r\\\\naway, the usual method of securing them is to tie them, one behind\\\\r\\\\nanother, to a long pole or rope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn marching off a Culprit, make him walk between two of your men, while a\\\\r\\\\nthird carrying a gun, walks behind him. If riding alone, tie the\\\\r\\\\nprisoner's hands together, and, taking your off-stirrup leather (for want\\\\r\\\\nof a cord), pass it round his left arm, and round your horse's girth, and\\\\r\\\\nbuckle it. The off-stirrup leather is the least inconvenient one to part\\\\r\\\\nwith, on account of mounting, and the prisoner is under your right hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTying on Horseback.--In cases where a prisoner has to be secured and\\\\r\\\\ngalloped off, there are but two ways: either putting him in the saddle\\\\r\\\\nand strapping his ankles together under the horse's belly--in which\\\\r\\\\ncase, if he be mad with rage, and attempts to throw himself off, the\\\\r\\\\nsaddle must turn with him; or else securing him Mazeppa-fashion--when\\\\r\\\\nfour loops are passed, one round each leg of the horse, and to each of\\\\r\\\\nthese is tied one limb of the prisoner, as he lies with his back against\\\\r\\\\nthat of the horse; a surcingle is also passed round both horse and man.\\\\r\\\\nIt is, of course, a barbarous method, but circumstances might arise when\\\\r\\\\nit would be of use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProceedings in case of Death.--If a man of the party dies, write down a\\\\r\\\\ndetailed account of the matter, and have it attested by the others,\\\\r\\\\nespecially if accident be the cause of his death. If a man be lost,\\\\r\\\\nbefore you turn away and abandon him to his fate, call the party formally\\\\r\\\\ntogether, and ask them if they are satisfied that you have done all that\\\\r\\\\nwas possible to save him, and record their answers. After death, it is\\\\r\\\\nwell to follow the custom at sea--i.e. to sell by auction all the dead\\\\r\\\\nman's effects among his comrades, deducting the money they fetch from the\\\\r\\\\npay of the buyers, to be handed over to his relatives on the return of\\\\r\\\\nthe expedition. The things will probably be sold at a much higher price\\\\r\\\\nthan they would elsewhere fetch, and the carriage of useless lumber is\\\\r\\\\nsaved. Any trinkets he may have had, should of course be sealed up and\\\\r\\\\nput aside, and not included in the sale: they should be collected in\\\\r\\\\npresence of the whole party, a list made of them, and the articles at\\\\r\\\\nonce packed up. In committing the body to the earth, choose a well-marked\\\\r\\\\nsituation, dig a deep grave, bush it with thorns, and weight it well over\\\\r\\\\nwith heavy stones, as a defence against animals of prey.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMECHANICAL APPLIANCES.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Raise and Move a Heavy Body.--On Land.--Lever up its ends alternately,\\\\r\\\\nand build underneath them when they are lifted up. After a sufficient\\\\r\\\\nheight has been gained, build a sloping causeway down to the place to\\\\r\\\\nwhich the mass has to be moved, and along which it may be dragged, with\\\\r\\\\nthe assistance of rollers and grease. If the mass be too awkwardly shaped\\\\r\\\\nto admit of this, burrow below it; pass poles underneath it, and raise\\\\r\\\\nthe ends of the poles alternately. Mr. Williams, the well-known\\\\r\\\\nmissionary of the South Sea Islands, relates how his schooner of from\\\\r\\\\nseventy to eighty tons had been driven by a violent hurricane and rising\\\\r\\\\nof the sea, on one of the islands near which she was anchored, and was\\\\r\\\\nlodged several hundred yards inland; and thus describes how he got her\\\\r\\\\nback:--\\\\\\\"The method by which we contrived to raise the vessel was\\\\r\\\\nexceedingly simple, and by it we were enabled to accomplish the task with\\\\r\\\\ngreat ease. Long levers were passed under her keel, with the fulcrum so\\\\r\\\\nfixed as to give them an elevation of about forty-five degrees. The ends\\\\r\\\\nof these were then fastened together with several cross-beams, upon which\\\\r\\\\na quantity of stones were placed; the weight of which gradually elevated\\\\r\\\\none end of the vessel, until the levers reached the ground. Propping up\\\\r\\\\nthe bow thus raised, we shifted our levers to the stern, which was in\\\\r\\\\nlike manner elevated; and, by repeating this process three or four times,\\\\r\\\\nwe lifted her in one day entirely out of the hole (which she had worked\\\\r\\\\nfor herself, and which was about four feet deep). The bog that lay\\\\r\\\\nbetween her and the sea was then filled up with stones, logs of wood were\\\\r\\\\nlaid across it, rollers were placed under the vessel, the chain cable\\\\r\\\\npassed round her; and, by the united strength of about 2000 people, she\\\\r\\\\nwas compelled to take a short voyage upon the land, before she floated in\\\\r\\\\nher pride on the sea.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn some cases, the body of a cart may be taken down, and deep ruts having\\\\r\\\\nbeen dug on each side of the mass, the vehicle can be backed, till the\\\\r\\\\naxletree comes across it; then, after lashing and making fast, the sand\\\\r\\\\ncan be shovelled from below the mass, which will hang suspended from the\\\\r\\\\naxletree, and may be carted away. Or a sledge may be built beneath the\\\\r\\\\nmass by burrowing below it and thrusting the poles beneath it. Then the\\\\r\\\\nremainder of the intervening sand can be shovelled away, and the mass,\\\\r\\\\nnow resting directly upon the sledge, can be dragged away by a team of\\\\r\\\\ncattle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA sarcophagus of immense weight was raised from out of a deep recess into\\\\r\\\\nwhich it had been fitted pretty closely, at the end of a long narrow\\\\r\\\\ngallery in an Egyptian tomb, where there was no room for the application\\\\r\\\\nof tackle or other machinery, by the simple expedient of slightly\\\\r\\\\ndisturbing it in its place and sifting sand into the narrow interval\\\\r\\\\nbetween its sides and the recess. This process was repeated continually:\\\\r\\\\nthe sand settled below the bottom of the sarcophagus, which gradually\\\\r\\\\nrose out of the hole in which it had lain. The principle of this piece of\\\\r\\\\nengineering was borrowed, I suppose, from observing that whenever a mass\\\\r\\\\nof sand and stones is shaken together, the stones invariably rise out of\\\\r\\\\nthe sand, the biggest of them always forming the highest layer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nExpansive Power of Wetted Seeds.--Admiral Sir E. Belcher read a curious\\\\r\\\\npaper before the British Association in 1866, showing the remarkable\\\\r\\\\npower to be obtained by filling tubes with peas or other seed, allowing\\\\r\\\\nthe weight to rest upon the surface of the peas through the medium of a\\\\r\\\\nrude piston. When the peas were wetted they swelled upwards with\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable force. A pint of peas placed in a tube of a diameter that\\\\r\\\\nwas not expressed in the newspaper report, from which I take this\\\\r\\\\naccount, lifted 60 lbs. through a height of one inch in twenty-four\\\\r\\\\nhours. The Admiral proposed to fix a number of tubes side by side in a\\\\r\\\\nframe below the mass to be lifted, preferring to use zinc tubes of from\\\\r\\\\ntwo or three inches in diameter, and of about one foot high. Thus, in the\\\\r\\\\nsmall space of a cubic foot, a large number of tubes (thirty-six in the\\\\r\\\\none case, sixteen in the other) could be made to act simultaneously; the\\\\r\\\\nforce of the stroke could be increased by arranging a number of frames\\\\r\\\\nside by side, or the length of the stroke could be increased by building\\\\r\\\\nthe frames in a series one above the other. I have elsewhere described\\\\r\\\\nhow wetted seeds may be used to restore the shape of a battered flask\\\\r\\\\neither for holding water or gunpowder (pp. 230).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nParbuckling.--A round log or a barrel should be rolled, not dragged; and\\\\r\\\\nmany irregularly-shaped objects may have bundles of faggots lashed round\\\\r\\\\nthem, by which they become barrel-shaped and fit to be rolled. In these\\\\r\\\\ncases, parbuckling doubles the ease of rolling them; one or more ropes\\\\r\\\\nhave one of each of their ends made fast in the direction to which the\\\\r\\\\nlog has to be rolled, while the other is carried underneath the log,\\\\r\\\\nround it, and back again. By pulling at these free ends, the log will be\\\\r\\\\nrolled on. An equivalent plan, and in some cases a more practicable one,\\\\r\\\\nis to make fast one end of the rope to the log itself; then, winding the\\\\r\\\\nrope two or three times round it, like cotton on a reel, to haul at the\\\\r\\\\nfree end as before. Horses can be used, as well as men, for this work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of man pulling log].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAccumulation of Efforts.--South American Indians are said to avail\\\\r\\\\nthemselves of their forest trees, and of the creepers which stretch from\\\\r\\\\nbranch to branch, in moving very heavy weights, as in lifting a log of\\\\r\\\\ntimber up on a stage to be sawn, in the following ingenious manner. The\\\\r\\\\nlabourer gets hold of one of these creepers that runs from the top boughs\\\\r\\\\nof a tree in the direction in which he wants to move his log, and pulling\\\\r\\\\nthis creeper home with all his force, bending down the bough, he attaches\\\\r\\\\nit to the log; then he goes to another creeper and does the same with\\\\r\\\\nthat; and so on until he has accumulated strain of many bent boughs,\\\\r\\\\nurging the log forward and of sufficient power to move it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShort cords of india-rubber with a hook at either end, are sold under the\\\\r\\\\nname of \\\\\\\"accumulators.\\\\\\\" It is proposed that each of these should be\\\\r\\\\nstretched and hooked by one of its ends to a fixed ring, and by the\\\\r\\\\nother, to the body to be moved; by applying a number of these, in\\\\r\\\\nsuccession, an immense accumulation of force can be obtained.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLevers.--A piece of green wood has insufficient strength to be used as a\\\\r\\\\ncrowbar; it must first be seasoned. (See \\\\\\\"Green Wood, to season.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Means of Raising Weights.--I do not propose to take space by\\\\r\\\\ndescribing jacks, ordinary pulleys, differential pulleys, Chinese\\\\r\\\\nwindlasses, and the like. It is sufficient that I should recall them by\\\\r\\\\nname to the traveller's recollection; for if he has access to any of\\\\r\\\\nthese things he is probably either a sailor or engineer and knows all\\\\r\\\\nabout them, or he is in a land where mechanical appliances are\\\\r\\\\nunderstood.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo raise Weights out of Water.--If the mass should lie below water, a\\\\r\\\\nboat may be brought over it and sunk to its gunwales; then, after making\\\\r\\\\nfast to it, the boat can be baled and the thing floated away. A raft\\\\r\\\\nweighted with stones will serve the same purpose. In some cases a raft\\\\r\\\\nmay be built round the mass during low water; then the returning tide or\\\\r\\\\nthe next flush of the stream will float it away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Although from its bulk several men might be puzzled to lift a cow-fish\\\\r\\\\nfrom the water when dead, yet one single Indian will stow the largest in\\\\r\\\\nhis montaria without assistance. The boat is sunk under the body, and\\\\r\\\\nrising, the difficult feat is accomplished.\\\\\\\" (Edwards' 'Amazon.')\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe huge blocks of marble quarried at Carrara are shipped in the small\\\\r\\\\nvessels of the country, as follows:--at low water the vessel is buried\\\\r\\\\nbodily in the sand, and a temporary railway laid down from the quarry to\\\\r\\\\nwithinside of it. Along this the blocks are conveyed, and, when deposited\\\\r\\\\nin the vessel, the sand is dug away from under them, and they settle down\\\\r\\\\nin its hold, and the ship floats away at the returning tide.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKNOTS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nElementary Knots.--The three elementary knots which every one should know\\\\r\\\\nare here represented--viz., the Timber-hitch, the Bowline, and the\\\\r\\\\nClove-hitch. (See also \\\\\\\"Knots,\\\\\\\" p. 49; \\\\\\\"Malay hitch,\\\\\\\" p. 147.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTimber-hitch.--The virtues of the timber-hitch (fig. 1, p. 326) are,\\\\r\\\\nthat, so long as the strain upon it is kept up, it will hold fast; when\\\\r\\\\nthe strain is taken off, it can be cast loose immediately. A timber-hitch\\\\r\\\\nhad better have the loose end twisted more than once, if the rope be\\\\r\\\\nstiff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBowline.--The bowline (fig. 2) makes a knot difficult to undo; with it\\\\r\\\\nthe ends of two strings are tied together, or a loop made at the end of a\\\\r\\\\nsingle piece of string, as in the drawing. For slip nooses, use the\\\\r\\\\nbowline to make the draw-loop. When tying a bowline, or any other knot\\\\r\\\\nfor temporary purposes, insert a stick into the knot before pulling\\\\r\\\\ntight. The stick will enable you, at will, to untie the knot--to break\\\\r\\\\nits back, as the sailors say--with little difficulty. A bowline is\\\\r\\\\nfirmer, if doubled; that is, if the free end of the cord be made to wrap\\\\r\\\\nround a second time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[3 fig of knots tied as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nClove-hitch.--The clove-hitch (fig. 3) binds with excessive force, and by\\\\r\\\\nit, and it alone, can a weight be hung to a perfectly smooth pole, as to\\\\r\\\\na tent-pole. A kind of double clove-hitch is generally used, but the\\\\r\\\\nsimple one suffices, and is more easily recollected. A double clove-hitch\\\\r\\\\nis firmer than a single one; that is, the rope should make two turns,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of one turn, round the pole beneath the lowest end of the cord in\\\\r\\\\nthe figure. (See\\\\\\\"Tent-poles, to tie things to.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKnots at End of Rope.--To make a large knot at the end of a piece of\\\\r\\\\nstring, to prevent it from pulling through a hole, turn the end of the\\\\r\\\\nstring back upon itself, so as to make it double, and then tie a common\\\\r\\\\nknot. The string may be quadrupled instead of doubled, if required.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nToggle and Strop.--This is a tourniquet. A single or a double band is\\\\r\\\\nmade to enclose the two pieces of wood it is desired to lash together;\\\\r\\\\nthen a stick is pushed into the band and forcibly twisted round. The band\\\\r\\\\nshould be of soft material, such as the strands of a rope that has been\\\\r\\\\npicked to pieces for that purpose: the strands must each of them, be\\\\r\\\\nuntwisted and well rubbed with a stick to take the kink out of them, and\\\\r\\\\nfinally twisted in a direction opposite to their original one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of knot as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo sling a Jar.--Put it in a handkerchief or a net.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo tie a Parcel on the back, like a Knapsack.--Take a cord 10 feet long,\\\\r\\\\ndouble it, and lay the loop end upon a rock or other convenient\\\\r\\\\nelevation; then place the object to be carried upon the cord, taking care\\\\r\\\\nthat the loop is so spread out as to admit of its ultimately enclosing\\\\r\\\\nthe object with a good hold and balance. Next pass the free ends of the\\\\r\\\\ncord over the object and through the loop; then, bringing your shoulder\\\\r\\\\nto a level with the package, draw the free ends of the cords over your\\\\r\\\\nright shoulder: the cords will by this time have assumed the appearance\\\\r\\\\nshown in the sketch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of cords as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow pass the left arm between the left-hand cord and the package at B,\\\\r\\\\nand the right arm between the right-hand cord and the package at C.\\\\r\\\\nLastly, draw the cords tight, and the object will be found to be fastened\\\\r\\\\non to your back like a knapsack. A gun may be passed between the cords\\\\r\\\\nand the top of the object. This is a capital method of carrying a load of\\\\r\\\\ngame over a broken country, where at least one hand is required to be\\\\r\\\\nfree. I am indebted to Mr. F. M. Wyndham for a knowledge of it: he found\\\\r\\\\nit frequently in use in Norway. In hot countries the plan would not be so\\\\r\\\\nconvenient, as the heat of a soft package strapped closely to the back is\\\\r\\\\nvery oppressive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWRITING MATERIALS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPaper.--Its Numerous Applications.--Captain Sherard Osborn, in writing of\\\\r\\\\nthe Japanese, says:--\\\\\\\"It was wonderful to see the thousand useful as well\\\\r\\\\nas ornamental purposes to which paper was applicable in the hands of\\\\r\\\\nthese industrious and tasteful people. Our papier-mache manufacturers, as\\\\r\\\\nwell as the Continental ones, should go to Yeddo to learn what can be\\\\r\\\\ndone with paper. With the aid of lacker varnish and skilful painting,\\\\r\\\\npaper made excellent trunks, tobacco bags, cigar cases, saddles,\\\\r\\\\ntelescope cases, the frames of microscopes; and we even saw and used\\\\r\\\\nexcellent water-proof coats made of simple paper, which did keep out the\\\\r\\\\nrain, and were as supple as the best macintosh . . . . . The inner walls\\\\r\\\\nof many a Japanese apartment are formed of paper, being nothing more than\\\\r\\\\npainted screens; their windows are covered with a fine translucent\\\\r\\\\ndescription of the same material; it enters largely into the manufacture\\\\r\\\\nof nearly everything in a Japanese household, and we saw what seemed\\\\r\\\\nballs of twine, which were nothing but long shreds of tough paper rolled\\\\r\\\\nup. . . . In short, without paper, all Japan would come to a dead lock.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSizing Paper.--The coarsest foreign paper can be sized, so as to prevent\\\\r\\\\nits blotting when written on, by simply dipping it in, or brushing it\\\\r\\\\nwell over with, milk and water, and letting it dry. A tenth part of milk\\\\r\\\\nis amply sufficient. Messrs. Huc and Gabet inform us that this is the\\\\r\\\\nregular process of sizing, as used by paper-makers in Thibet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitutes for Paper are chips of wood, inner bark of trees, calico and\\\\r\\\\nother tissues, lead plates, and slaty stone. I knew an eminent engineer\\\\r\\\\nwho habitually jotted his pencil memoranda on the well-starched wristband\\\\r\\\\nof his left shirt-sleeve, pushing back the cuff of his coat in order to\\\\r\\\\nexpose it. The natives in some parts of Bengal, when in the jungle, write\\\\r\\\\non any large smooth leaf with the broken-off moist end of a leaf-stalk or\\\\r\\\\ntwig of any milky sap-producing tree. They then throw dust upon it, which\\\\r\\\\nmakes the writing legible. If the leaf be so written upon, the writing is\\\\r\\\\nimperceptible until the dust is sprinkled. This plan might, therefore, be\\\\r\\\\nof use for concealed writing. A person could write on the leaf without\\\\r\\\\ndetaching it from the tree. (See Sympathetic Ink.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrepared Paper, for use with pencils of metallic lead (see \\\\\\\"Pencils\\\\\\\"), is\\\\r\\\\nmade by rubbing a paste of weak glue and bones burnt to whiteness and\\\\r\\\\npounded, on the surface of the paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWaxed Paper is an excellent substitute for tin-foil, for excluding the\\\\r\\\\nair and damp from parcels. It is made by spreading a sheet of writing\\\\r\\\\npaper on a hot plate or stone and smearing it with wax. A hot flat-iron\\\\r\\\\nis convenient for making it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarbonised Paper, for tracing or for manifold writing, is made by rubbing\\\\r\\\\na mixture of soap, lampblack, and a little water on the paper, and, when\\\\r\\\\ndry, wiping off as much as possible with a cloth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTracing Designs.--Transparent tracing-paper can hardly be made by a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller, unless he contents himself with the use of waxed paper; but he\\\\r\\\\nmay prick out the leading points of his map or other design, and laying\\\\r\\\\nthe map on a sheet of clean paper, charcoal or other powder that will\\\\r\\\\nleave a stain, it can be rubbed through.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBook-binding.--Travellers' unbound books become so terribly dilapidated,\\\\r\\\\nthat I think it well to give a detailed description of a method of\\\\r\\\\nbook-binding which a relative of mine has adopted for many years with\\\\r\\\\nremarkable success, and to a great extent. The books are not\\\\r\\\\ntidy-looking, but they open flat and never fall to pieces. Take a cup of\\\\r\\\\npaste; a piece of calico or other cloth, large enough to cover the back\\\\r\\\\nand sides of the book; a strip of strong linen--if you can get it, if\\\\r\\\\nnot, of calico--to cover the back; and abundance of stout cotton or\\\\r\\\\nthread. 1st. Paste the strip of linen down the back, and leave the book\\\\r\\\\nin the sun or near a fire--but not too near it--to dry, which it will do\\\\r\\\\nin half a day. 2ndly. Open the book and look for the place where the\\\\r\\\\nstiching is to be seen down the middle of the pages, or, in other words,\\\\r\\\\nfor the middle of the sheets; if it be an 8vo. book it will be at every\\\\r\\\\n16th page, if a 12mo. at every 24th page, and so on: it is a mere matter\\\\r\\\\nof semi-mechanical reckoning to know where each succeeding stitching is\\\\r\\\\nto be found; in this volume the stitching is at pages 216,\\\\r\\\\netc., the interval being 16 pages. Next take the cotton and wind it in\\\\r\\\\nbetween the pages where the stitching is, and over the back round and\\\\r\\\\nround, beginning with the first sheet, and going on sheet after sheet\\\\r\\\\nuntil you have reached the last one. 3rdly. Lay the book on the table\\\\r\\\\nback upwards, daub it thoroughly with paste, put on the calico cover as\\\\r\\\\nneatly as you can, and set it to dry as before; when dry it is complete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther Materials for Writing.--Quills and other Pens.--Any feather that is\\\\r\\\\nlarge enough, can be at once made into a good writing-quill. It has only\\\\r\\\\nto be dipped in hot sand, which causes the membrane inside the quill to\\\\r\\\\nshrivel up, and the outside membrane to split and peel off: a few\\\\r\\\\ninstants are sufficient to do this. The proper temperature of the sand is\\\\r\\\\nabout 340 degrees. The operation may be repeated with advantage two or\\\\r\\\\nthree times. Reeds are in universal use throughout the East for writing\\\\r\\\\nwith ink. Flat fish-bones make decent pens.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPencil.--Lead pencils were literally made of the metal lead in former\\\\r\\\\ndays; and there are some parts of the world, as in Arabia, where they are\\\\r\\\\nstill to be met with. A piece of lead may be cast into a serviceable\\\\r\\\\nshape in the method described under \\\\\\\"Lead,\\\\\\\" and will make a legible mark\\\\r\\\\nupon ordinary paper. Lead is the best material for writing in note-books\\\\r\\\\nof \\\\\\\"Prepared Paper) (which see). A better sort of pencil for general use\\\\r\\\\nis made by sawing charcoal into narrow strips, and laying them in melted\\\\r\\\\nwax to drench for a couple of days, they are then ready for use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPaint brushes.--Wash the bit of tail or skin, whence the hair is to be\\\\r\\\\ntaken, in ox-gall, till it is quite free from grease. Then snip off the\\\\r\\\\nhairs close to the skin, put them points downwards resting in a box, and\\\\r\\\\npick out the long hairs. After a sufficient quantity have been obtained\\\\r\\\\nof about the same length, a piece of string is knotted tightly round\\\\r\\\\nthem, and pulled firm with the aid of two sticks. Then a quill, that has\\\\r\\\\nbeen soaked in water for a day in order to soften it, is taken, and the\\\\r\\\\npinch of hair is put into the large end of the quill, points forward, and\\\\r\\\\npushed right through to the other end with a bit of stick, and so the\\\\r\\\\nbrush is made. The chinese paint-brush is a feather--a woodcock's feather\\\\r\\\\nis often used. Feather, like hairs, must be washed in ox-gall.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInk.--Excellent writing-ink may be made in the bush. The readiest way of\\\\r\\\\nmaking it is to blacken sticks in the fire and to rub them well in a\\\\r\\\\nspoonful of milk till the milk becomes quite black. Gunpowder or\\\\r\\\\nlamp-soot will do as well as the burnt stick; and water, with the\\\\r\\\\naddition of a very little gum, glue, or fish-glue (isinglass) is better\\\\r\\\\nthan the milk, as it will not so soon turn sour. Indian ink is simply\\\\r\\\\nlamp-soot and some kind of glue: it is one of the best of inks. If pure\\\\r\\\\nwater be used, instead of gum or glue and water, the writing will rub out\\\\r\\\\nvery easily when dry, the use of the milk, gum, or glue being to fix it:\\\\r\\\\nanything else that is glutinous will serve as well as these. Strong\\\\r\\\\ncoffee, and many other vegetable products, such as the bark of trees\\\\r\\\\nboiled in water, make a mark which is very legible and will not rub.\\\\r\\\\nBlood is an indifferent substitute for ink. To make 12 gallons of good\\\\r\\\\ncommon writing-ink, use 12 lbs. of nut-galls, 5 lbs. of green sulphate of\\\\r\\\\niron, 5 lbs. of gum, and 12 gallons of water. (Ure.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLampblack.--Hold a piece of metal, or even a stone, over a flaring wick\\\\r\\\\nin a cup of oil, and plenty of soot will collect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSympathetic Ink.--Nothing is better or handier than milk. The writing is\\\\r\\\\ninvisible until the paper is almost toasted in the fire, when it turns a\\\\r\\\\nrich brown. The juice of lemons and many other fruits may also be used.\\\\r\\\\n(See \\\\\\\"Substitutes for Paper.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGall of Animals, or Ox-gall to purify.--To make ink or paint take upon\\\\r\\\\ngreasy paper, a very little ox-gall should be mixed with it. It is very\\\\r\\\\nimportant to know this simple remedy, and I therefore extract the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing information from Ure's 'Dictionary.' I have often practised it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Take it from the newly-killed animal, let it settle for 12 or 15 hours\\\\r\\\\nin a basin, pour the liquid off the sediment into an earthenware pot, and\\\\r\\\\nset the pot into a pan of water kept boiling until the gall-liquid\\\\r\\\\nbecomes somewhat thick. Then spread it on a dish and place it before the\\\\r\\\\nfire till nearly dry. In this state it may be kept, without any looking\\\\r\\\\nafter, for years. When wanted, a piece the size of a pea should be\\\\r\\\\ndissolved in water. Ox-gall removes all grease-spots from clothes, etc.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWafers, Paste, and Gum.--Wafers.--The common wafers are punched out of a\\\\r\\\\nsheet made of a paste of flour and water that has suddenly been baked\\\\r\\\\nhard. Gum wafers are punched out of a sheet made of thick gum and water\\\\r\\\\npoured on a slightly-greased surface (a looking-glass for example),\\\\r\\\\nanother greased glass having been put on the top of the gum to make it\\\\r\\\\ndry even.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPaste should be made like arrowroot, by mixing the flour in a minimum of\\\\r\\\\ncold water, and then pouring a flush of absolutely boiling water upon it.\\\\r\\\\nIt is made a trifle thicker and more secure from insects by the addition\\\\r\\\\nof alum. Corrosive sublimate is a more powerful protection against\\\\r\\\\ninsects, but is by no means an absolute safeguard, and it is dangerous to\\\\r\\\\nuse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGum.--The white of eggs forms a substitute for gum. Some sea-weeds yield\\\\r\\\\ngum. (See also \\\\\\\"Glue,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Isinglass,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Sealing-wax Varnish.\\\\\\\")\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSignets.--Many excellent and worthy bushmen have the misfortune of not\\\\r\\\\nknowing how to write: should any such be placed in a post of confidence\\\\r\\\\nby an explorer, it might be well that he should cut for himself a signet\\\\r\\\\nout of soft stone--such as the europeans of bygone generations, and the\\\\r\\\\nTurks of the last one, very generally employed. A device is cut on the\\\\r\\\\nseal; before using it, the paper is moistened with a wet finger, and the\\\\r\\\\nink is dabbed over the ring with another; the impression is then made,\\\\r\\\\nusing the ball of the thumb for a pad.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSealing-wax Varnish.--Black or red sealing-wax, dissolved in spirits of\\\\r\\\\nwine, makes a very effective stiff and waterproof varnish, especially for\\\\r\\\\nboxes of paper or cardboard. It might be useful in keeping some iron\\\\r\\\\nthings from rust: it is the same material that is used to cover toy\\\\r\\\\nmagnets. When made stiff it is an excellent cement for small articles.\\\\r\\\\nOpticians employ it for many of these purposes. I have also used it as a\\\\r\\\\npaint for marking initials on luggage, cutting out the letters in paper\\\\r\\\\nand dabbing the red stuff through.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmall Boxes for Specimens.--Cut the side of a cigar-box, or a strip of\\\\r\\\\npasteboard, half through in three places, add two smaller pieces like\\\\r\\\\nwings, one on each side, by means of a piece of gummed paper overlapping\\\\r\\\\nthem, as in the picture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of box unfolded and folded].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAny number of these may be carried like the leaves of a book, and when a\\\\r\\\\nbox is wanted they may be bent into shape, and by the adherence of the\\\\r\\\\nmoistened gum-paper, can be made into a box at a moment's notice. The\\\\r\\\\nshaded border of the figure represents the gummed paper. Quills make\\\\r\\\\nconvenient receptacles for minute specimens. They should be dressed (see\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Quills\\\\\\\"), and may be corked with a plug of wood or wax, or, for greater\\\\r\\\\nsecurity, a small quill may be pushed, mouth forward, into a larger one,\\\\r\\\\nas into a sheath.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTIMBER.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGreen Wood.--To season Wood.--Green wood cannot be employed in carpentry,\\\\r\\\\nas it is very weak; it also warps, cracks, and becomes rotten: wood dried\\\\r\\\\nwith too great a heat loses its toughness as well as its pliability: it\\\\r\\\\nbecomes hard and brittle. Green wood is seasoned by washing out the sap,\\\\r\\\\nand then drying it thoroughly. The traveller's way of doing this by one\\\\r\\\\nrapid operation, is to dig a long trench and make a roaring fire in it;\\\\r\\\\nwhen the ground is burning hot, sweep the ashes away, deluge the trench\\\\r\\\\nwith boiling water; and in the middle of the clouds of steam that arise,\\\\r\\\\nthrow in the log of wood, shovel hot earth over it, and leave it to steam\\\\r\\\\nand bake. A log thick enough to make an axletree may thus be somewhat\\\\r\\\\nseasoned in a single night. The log would be seasoned more thoroughly if\\\\r\\\\nit were saturated with boiling water before putting it into the trench;\\\\r\\\\nthat can be done by laying it in a deep narrow puddle, and shovelling hot\\\\r\\\\nstones into the water. All crowbars, wagon-lifters, etc., should be\\\\r\\\\nroughly seasoned as green wood is far too weak for such uses. The regular\\\\r\\\\nway of seasoning is to leave the timber to soak for a long time in water,\\\\r\\\\nthat the juices may be washed out. Fresh water is better for this purpose\\\\r\\\\nthan salt; but a mineral spring, if it is warm is better than cold fresh\\\\r\\\\nwater. Parties travelling with a wagon ought to fell a little timber on\\\\r\\\\ntheir outward journey, and leave it to season against their return, in\\\\r\\\\nreadiness to replace strained axletrees, broken poles, and the like. They\\\\r\\\\nmight, at all events, cut a ring round through the bark and sap-wood of\\\\r\\\\nthe tree, and leave it to discharge its juices, die, and become\\\\r\\\\nhalf-seasoned as it stands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo bend Wood.--If it is wished to bend a rod of wood, or to straighten it\\\\r\\\\nif originally crooked, it must be steamed, or at least be submitted to\\\\r\\\\nhot water. Thus a rod of green wood may be passed through the ashes of a\\\\r\\\\nsmouldering fire and, when hot, bent and shaped with the hand; but if the\\\\r\\\\nwood be dry it must first be thoroughly soaked in a pond or puddle. If\\\\r\\\\nthe puddle is made to boil by shovelling in hot stones, as described in\\\\r\\\\nthe last paragraph, the stick will bend more easily. the long straight\\\\r\\\\nspears of savages are often made of exceedingly crooked sticks,\\\\r\\\\nstraightened in the ashes of their camp fires. A thick piece of wood may\\\\r\\\\nbe well swabbed with hot water, forcibly bent, as far as can be safely\\\\r\\\\ndone, tied in position and steamed, as if for the purpose of seasoning\\\\r\\\\n(see last paragraph), in a trench; after a quarter of an hour it must be\\\\r\\\\ntaken out, damped afresh if necessary, bent further, and again returned\\\\r\\\\nto steam--the process being repeated till the wood has attained the shape\\\\r\\\\nrequired; it should then be left in the trench to season thoroughly. The\\\\r\\\\nheads of dog-sledges, and the pieces of wood used for the outsides of\\\\r\\\\nsnow-shoes, are all bent by this process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarpenters' Tools.--Tools of too hard steel should not be taken on a\\\\r\\\\njourney; they splinter against the dense wood of tropical countries, and\\\\r\\\\nthey are very troublesome to sharpen. The remedy for over-hardness is to\\\\r\\\\nheat them red-hot; retempering them by quenching in grease. A small iron\\\\r\\\\naxe, with a file to sharpen it, and a few awls, are (if nothing else can\\\\r\\\\nbe taken) a very useful outfit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs much carpentry as a traveller is likely to want can be effected by\\\\r\\\\nmeans of a small axe with a hammer-head, a very small single-handed adze,\\\\r\\\\na mortise-chisel, a strong gouge, a couple of medium-sized gimlets, a few\\\\r\\\\nawls, a small Turkey-hone, and a whetstone. If a saw be taken, it should\\\\r\\\\nbe of a sort intended for green wood. In addition to these, a small tin\\\\r\\\\nbox full of tools, all of which fit into a single handle, is very\\\\r\\\\nvaluable; many travellers have found them extremely convenient. There is\\\\r\\\\na tool-shop near the bottom of the Haymarket and another in the Strand\\\\r\\\\nnear the Lowthier Arcade, where they can be bought; probably also at\\\\r\\\\nHoltzapfel's in Trafalgar Square. The box that contains them is about six\\\\r\\\\ninches long by four broad and one deep; the cost is from 20s. to 30s.\\\\r\\\\nLastly, a saw for metals, a few drills, and small files, may be added\\\\r\\\\nwith advantage. It is advisable to see that the tools are ground and set\\\\r\\\\nbefore starting. A small \\\\\\\"hard chisel\\\\\\\" of the best steel, three inches\\\\r\\\\nlong, a quarter of an inch wide, and three-eighths thick--which any\\\\r\\\\nblacksmith can make--will cut iron, will chisel marks on rocks, and be\\\\r\\\\nuseful in numerous emergencies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSharpening Tools.--A man will get through most work with his tools, if he\\\\r\\\\nstops from time to time to sharpen them up. The son of Sirach says,\\\\r\\\\nspeaking of a carpenter--\\\\\\\"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the\\\\r\\\\nedge, then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is profitable to\\\\r\\\\ndirect.\\\\\\\"--Ecclesiasticus. A small fine file is very effectual in giving\\\\r\\\\nan edge to tools of soft steel. It is a common error to suppose that the\\\\r\\\\nbest edge is given by grinding the sides of the tool until they meet at\\\\r\\\\nan exceedingly acute angle. Such an edge would have no strength, and\\\\r\\\\nwould chip or bend directly. The proper way of sharpening a tool, is to\\\\r\\\\ngrind it until it is sufficiently thin, and then to give it an edge whose\\\\r\\\\nsides are inclined to one another, about as much as those of the letter\\\\r\\\\nV. The edge of a chisel is an obvious case in point; so also is the edge\\\\r\\\\nof a butcher's knife, which is given by applying it to the steel at a\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable inclination. A razor has only to cut hairs, and will\\\\r\\\\nsplinter if used to mend a pen, yet even a razor is shaped like a wedge,\\\\r\\\\nthat it may not receive too fine an edge when stropped with its face flat\\\\r\\\\nupon the hone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNails, Substitutes for.--Lashings of raw hide supersede nails for almost\\\\r\\\\nevery purpose. It is perfectly marvellous how a gunstock, that has been\\\\r\\\\nshattered into splinters, can be made as strong again as ever, by means\\\\r\\\\nof raw hide sewn round it and left to dry; or by drawing the skin of an\\\\r\\\\nox's leg like a stocking over it. It is well to treat your bit of skin as\\\\r\\\\nthough parchment (which see) were to be made of it, burying the skin and\\\\r\\\\nscraping off the hair, before sewing it on, that it may make no eyesore.\\\\r\\\\nTendons, or stout fish-skin such as shagreen, may also be used on the\\\\r\\\\nsame principle. An axle-tree, cracked lengthwise, can easily be mended\\\\r\\\\nwith raw hide; even a broken wheel-tire may be replaced with rhinoceros\\\\r\\\\nor other thick hide; if the country to be travelled over be dry.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSketch of lathe as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLathes may be wanted by a traveller, because the pulleys necessary for a\\\\r\\\\nlarge sailing-boat, and the screw of a carpenter's bench, cannot be made\\\\r\\\\nwithout one. The sketch will recall to mind the original machine, now\\\\r\\\\nalmost forgotten in England, but still in common use on the Continent. It\\\\r\\\\nis obvious that makeshift contrivances can be set up on this principle,\\\\r\\\\ntwo steady points being the main things wanted. A forked bough suffices\\\\r\\\\nfor a treadle. A very common Indian lathe consists of two tent-pegs, two\\\\r\\\\nnails for the points; a leather thong, and some makeshift hand-rest;\\\\r\\\\nneither pole nor treadle is used, but an assistant takes one end of the\\\\r\\\\nthong in one hand, and the other end in the other hand, and hauls away in\\\\r\\\\na see-saw fashion. For turning hollows, a long spike is used instead of a\\\\r\\\\nshort point: then, a hole is bored into the wood to the depth of the\\\\r\\\\nintended hollow, and the spike is pushed forward until it abuts against\\\\r\\\\nthe bottom of the hole. One form of lathe is simplicity itself: two thick\\\\r\\\\nstakes are driven in the ground, so far apart as to include the object to\\\\r\\\\nbe turned; a cross piece is lashed to them (by a creeper cut out of the\\\\r\\\\njungle), for the double purpose of holding them together, and of serving\\\\r\\\\nas a rest for the gouge. The object is turned with a thong, as already\\\\r\\\\ndescribed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCharcoal, Tar, and Pitch.--Charcoal.--Dig a hole in the earth, or choose\\\\r\\\\nsome gigantic burrow, or old well, and fill it with piles of wood,\\\\r\\\\narranging them so as to leave a kind of chimney down the centre: the top\\\\r\\\\nof the hole is now to be covered over with sods excepting the chimney,\\\\r\\\\ndown which a brand is dropped to set fire to the wood. The burning should\\\\r\\\\nbe governed by opening or shutting the chimney-top with a flat stone; it\\\\r\\\\nshould proceed very gradually, for the wood ought to smoulder, and never\\\\r\\\\nattain to a bright red heat: the operation will require from two days to\\\\r\\\\na week. The tarry products of the wood drain to the bottom of the well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTar is made by burning larch, fir, or pine, as though charcoal had to be\\\\r\\\\nmade; dead or withered trees, and especially their roots, yield tar most\\\\r\\\\ncopiously. A vast deal is easily obtained. It collects at the bottom of\\\\r\\\\nthe pit, and a hole with smooth sides should be dug there, into which it\\\\r\\\\nmay drain. For making tar on a smaller scale:--ram an iron pot full of\\\\r\\\\npine wood; reverse it and lay it upon a board pierced with a hole one\\\\r\\\\ninch in diameter; then prop the board over another pot buried in the\\\\r\\\\nearth. Make all air-tight with wet clay round the upper pot and board,\\\\r\\\\ncovering the board, but exposing the bottom of the reversed pot. Make a\\\\r\\\\ngrand fire above and round the latter, and the tar will freely drop. It\\\\r\\\\nwill be thin and not very pure tar, but clean, and it will thicken on\\\\r\\\\nexposure to the air.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPitch is tar boiled down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTurpentine and Resin.--Turpentine is the juice secreted by the pine, fir,\\\\r\\\\nor larch tree, in blisters under the bark; the trees are tapped for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose of obtaining it. Resin is turpentine boiled down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMETALS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFuel for Forge.--Dry fuel gives out far more heat than that which is\\\\r\\\\ndamp. As a comparison of the heating powers of different sorts of fuel,\\\\r\\\\nit may be reckoned that 1 lb. of dry charcoal will raise 73 lbs. of water\\\\r\\\\nfrom freezing to boiling; 1 lb. of pit coal, about 60 lbs.; and 1 lb. of\\\\r\\\\npeat, about 30 lbs. Some kinds of manure-fuel give intense heat, and are\\\\r\\\\nexcellent for blacksmith's purposes: that of goats and sheep is the best;\\\\r\\\\ncamels' dung is next best, but is not nearly so good; then that of oxen:\\\\r\\\\nthe dung of horses is of little use, except as tinder in lighting a fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBellows.--It is of no use attempting to do blacksmith's work, if you have\\\\r\\\\nnot a pair of bellows. These can be made of a single goat-skin, of\\\\r\\\\nsufficient power, in skilful hands, to raise small bars of iron to a\\\\r\\\\nwelding heat. The boat's head is cut off close under the chin, his legs\\\\r\\\\nat the knee-joint, and a slit is made between the hind legs, through\\\\r\\\\nwhich the carcase is entirely extracted.After dressing the hide, two\\\\r\\\\nstrongish pieces of wood are sewn along the slit, one at each side, just\\\\r\\\\nlike the ironwork on each side of the mouth of a carpet-bag, and for the\\\\r\\\\nsame purpose, i.e. to strengthen it: a nozzle is inserted at the neck. To\\\\r\\\\nuse this apparatus, its mouth is opened, and pulled out; then it is\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly shut, by which means the bellows are made to enclose a bagful of\\\\r\\\\nair; this, by pushing the mouth flat home, is ejected through the nozzle.\\\\r\\\\nThese bellows require no valve, and are the simplest that can be made:\\\\r\\\\nthey are in use throughout India. The nozzle or tube to convey the blast\\\\r\\\\nmay be made of a plaster of clay or loam, mixed with grass, and moulded\\\\r\\\\nround a smooth pole.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMetals, to work.--Iron Ore is more easily reduced than the ore of any\\\\r\\\\nother metal: it is usually sufficient to throw the ore into a\\\\r\\\\ncharcoal-fire and keep it there for a day or more, when the pure metal\\\\r\\\\nwill begin to appear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWelding Composition for iron or steel, is made of borax 10 parts, sal\\\\r\\\\nammoniac 1 part; to be melted, run out on an iron plate, and, when cold,\\\\r\\\\npounded for use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCast Steel.--A mixture of 100 parts of soft iron, and two of lamp-soot,\\\\r\\\\nmelts as easily as ordinary steel--more easily than iron. This is a ready\\\\r\\\\nway of making cast-steel where great heat cannot be obtained.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCase-hardening is the name given to a simple process, by which the\\\\r\\\\noutside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and\\\\r\\\\nkeys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are fashioned first, and\\\\r\\\\ncase-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, because\\\\r\\\\nit is the cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel\\\\r\\\\nis hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel,\\\\r\\\\ncombines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of\\\\r\\\\ncase-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate\\\\r\\\\nof potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated,\\\\r\\\\nuntil the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated\\\\r\\\\nthree or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of\\\\r\\\\nsteel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of\\\\r\\\\npotash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is\\\\r\\\\na very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of\\\\r\\\\nleather, hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has\\\\r\\\\nanimal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire,\\\\r\\\\nand powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of\\\\r\\\\nthis charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first\\\\r\\\\nplaced near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should\\\\r\\\\nbe allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break\\\\r\\\\nopen the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLead is very useful to a traveller, for he always has bullets, which\\\\r\\\\nfurnish the supply of the metal, and it is so fusible that he can readily\\\\r\\\\nmelt and cast it into any required shape; using wood, or paper, partly\\\\r\\\\nburied in the earth, for his mould. If a small portion of the lead remain\\\\r\\\\nunmelted in the ladle, the fluid is sure not to burn the mould. By\\\\r\\\\nattending to this a wooden mould may be used scores of times.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketches as described below].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFig. 1 shows how to cast a leaden plate, which would be useful for\\\\r\\\\ninscriptions, for notices to other parties. If minced into squares, it\\\\r\\\\nwould make a substitute for slugs. The figure represents two flat pieces\\\\r\\\\nof wood, enclosing a folded piece of paper, and partly buried in the\\\\r\\\\nearth the lead is to be poured into the paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo make a mould for a pencil, or a rod which may be cut into short\\\\r\\\\nlengths for slugs, roll up a piece of paper as shown in fig. 2, and bury\\\\r\\\\nit in the earth: reeds, when they are to be obtained, make a stronger\\\\r\\\\nmould than paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo cast a lamp, a bottle, or other hollow article, use a cylinder of\\\\r\\\\npaper, buried in the ground, as in fig. 3, and hold a stick fast in the\\\\r\\\\nmiddle, while the lead is poured round.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLoose, shaky articles often admit of being set to rights, by warming the\\\\r\\\\njoints and pouring a little melted lead into the cracks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTin.--Solder for tin plates, is made of one or two parts of tin, and one\\\\r\\\\nof lead. Before soldering, the surfaces must be quite bright and close\\\\r\\\\ntogether; and the contact of air must be excluded during the operation,\\\\r\\\\nelse the heat will tarnish the surface and prevent the adhesion of the\\\\r\\\\nsolder: the borax and resin commonly in use, effect this. The best plan\\\\r\\\\nis to clean the surfaces with muriatic acid saturated with tin: this\\\\r\\\\nmethod is invariably adopted by watchmakers and opticians, who never use\\\\r\\\\nborax and resin. The point of the soldering-tool must be filed bright.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCopper, to tin.--Clean the copper well with sandstone; heat it, and rub\\\\r\\\\nit with sal-ammoniac till it is quite clean and bright; the tin, with\\\\r\\\\nsome powdered resin, is now placed on the copper, which is made so hot as\\\\r\\\\nto melt the tin, and allow it to be spread over the surface with a bit of\\\\r\\\\nrag. A very little tin is used in this way: it is said that a piece as\\\\r\\\\nbig as a pea, would tin a large saucepan; which is at the rate of twenty\\\\r\\\\ngrains of tin to a square foot of copper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLEATHER.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRaw Hides.--Dressing Hides.--Skins that have been dressed are essential\\\\r\\\\nto a traveller in an uncivilised country, for they make his\\\\r\\\\npacking-straps, his bags, his clothes, shoes, nails, and string,\\\\r\\\\ntherefore no hide should be wasted. There is no clever secret in dressing\\\\r\\\\nskins: it is hard work that they want, either continual crumpling and\\\\r\\\\nstretching with the hands, or working and trampling with the feet. To\\\\r\\\\ndress a goat-skin will occupy one person for a whole day, to dress an\\\\r\\\\nox-hide will give hard labour to two persons for a day and a half, or\\\\r\\\\neven for two days. It is best to begin to operate upon the skin half an\\\\r\\\\nhour after it has been flayed. If it has been allowed to dry during the\\\\r\\\\nprocess, it must be re-softened by damping, not with water--for it will\\\\r\\\\nnever end by being supple, if water be used--but with whatever the\\\\r\\\\nnatives generally employ: clotted milk and linseed-meal are used in\\\\r\\\\nAbyssinia; cow-dung by the Caffres and Bushmen. When a skin is put aside\\\\r\\\\nfor the night, it must be rolled up, to prevent it from becoming dry by\\\\r\\\\nthe morning. It is generally necessary to slightly grease the skin, when\\\\r\\\\nit is half-dressed, to make it thoroughly supple.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSmoking Hides.--Mr. Catlin, speaking of the skins used by the N. American\\\\r\\\\nIndians, says that the greater part of them \\\\\\\"go through still another\\\\r\\\\noperation afterwards (besides dressing), which gives them a greater\\\\r\\\\nvalue, and renders them much more serviceable--that is, the process of\\\\r\\\\nsmoking. For this, a small hole is dug in the ground, and a fire is built\\\\r\\\\nin it with rotten wood, which will produce a great quantity of smoke\\\\r\\\\nwithout much blaze, and several small poles of the proper length stuck in\\\\r\\\\nthe ground around it, and drawn and fastened together at the top (making\\\\r\\\\na cone), around which a skin is wrapped in form of a tent, and generally\\\\r\\\\nsewed together at the edges to secure the smoke within it: within this\\\\r\\\\nthe skins to be smoked are placed, and in this condition the tent will\\\\r\\\\nstand a day or two, enclosing the heated smoke; and by some chemical\\\\r\\\\nprocess of other, which I do not understand, the skins thus acquire a\\\\r\\\\nquality which enables them, after being ever so many times wet, to dry\\\\r\\\\nsoft and pliant as they were before, which secret I have never seen\\\\r\\\\npractised in my own country, and for the lack of which all our dressed\\\\r\\\\nskins, when once wet, are, I think, chiefly ruined.\\\\\\\" A single skin may\\\\r\\\\nconveniently be smoked by sewing the edges together, so as to make a tube\\\\r\\\\nof it: the lower end is tied round an iron pot with rotten wood burning\\\\r\\\\ninside, the upper end is kept open with a hoop, and slung to a triangle,\\\\r\\\\nas shown in the figure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of hide smoking apparatus as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTanning Hides.--Steep them in a strong solution of alum and a little\\\\r\\\\nsalt, for a period dependent on the thickness of the hide. The gradual\\\\r\\\\nchange of the hide into tanned leather is visible, and should be watched.\\\\r\\\\nIf desired, thehair may be removed before the operation, as described in\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Parchment;\\\\\\\" kid gloves are made of leather that has been prepared in\\\\r\\\\nthis way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGreasing Leather.--All leather articles should be occasionally well\\\\r\\\\nrubbed with fat, when used in hot, dry climates, or when they are often\\\\r\\\\nwetted and dried again: it makes a difference of many hundred per cent.\\\\r\\\\nin their wear. It is a great desideratum to be possessed of a supply of\\\\r\\\\nfat, but it is not easy to obtain it from antelopes and other sinewy\\\\r\\\\ngame. The French troops adopt the following method, which Lord Lucan\\\\r\\\\ncopied from them, when in the Crimea:--the marrowbones of the slaughtered\\\\r\\\\nanimals are broken between stones; they are then well boiled, and the\\\\r\\\\nbroth is skimmed when cold.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo preserve Hides in a dried State.--After the hide has been flayed from\\\\r\\\\na beast, if it is not intended to \\\\\\\"dress\\\\\\\" it, it should be pegged out in\\\\r\\\\nthe sun. If it be also rubbed over with wood-ashes, or better still with\\\\r\\\\nsalt, it will keep longer. Most small furs that reach the hands of\\\\r\\\\nEnglish furriers have been merely sun-dried; but large hides are usually\\\\r\\\\nsalted, before being shipped for Europe to be tanned. A hide that has\\\\r\\\\nbeen salted is injured for dressing by the hand, but it is not entirely\\\\r\\\\nspoiled: and therefore the following extract from Mr. Dana's 'Two Years\\\\r\\\\nbefore the Mast' may be of service to travellers who have shot many head\\\\r\\\\nof game in one place, or to those who have lost a herd of goats by\\\\r\\\\ndistemper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSalting Hides.--\\\\\\\"The first thing is to put the hides to soak. This is\\\\r\\\\ndone by carrying them down at low tide, and making them fast in small\\\\r\\\\npiles by ropes, and letting the tide come up and cover them. Every day we\\\\r\\\\nput 25 in soak for each man, which with us make 150. There they lie 48\\\\r\\\\nhours, when they are taken out and rolled up in wheelbarrows, and thrown\\\\r\\\\ninto vats. These vats contain brine made very strong, being sea-water\\\\r\\\\nwith great quantities of salt thrown in. This pickles the hides, and in\\\\r\\\\nthis they lie 48 hours: the use of the sea-water into which they are\\\\r\\\\nfirst put being merely to soften and clean them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"From these vats they are taken to lie on a platform 24 hours, and are\\\\r\\\\nthen spread upon the ground and carefully stretched and staked out, so\\\\r\\\\nthat they may dry smooth. After they were staked, and while yet wet and\\\\r\\\\nsoft, we used to go upon them with our knives, and carefully cut of all\\\\r\\\\nthe bad parts: the pieces of meat and fat, which would otherwise corrupt\\\\r\\\\nand affect the whole if stowed away in a vessel for months, the large\\\\r\\\\nflippers, the ears, and all other parts that prevent close stowage. This\\\\r\\\\nwas the most difficult part of our duty, as it required much skill to\\\\r\\\\ntake off everything necessary, and not to cut or injure the hides. It was\\\\r\\\\nalso a long process, as six of us had to clean 150; most of which\\\\r\\\\nrequired a great deal to be done to them, as the Spaniards are very\\\\r\\\\ncareless in skinning their cattle. Then, too, as we cleaned them while\\\\r\\\\nthey were staked out, we were obliged to kneel down upon them, which\\\\r\\\\nalways gives beginners the back-ache. The first day I was so slow and\\\\r\\\\nawkward that I only cleaned eight; at the end of a few days I doubled my\\\\r\\\\nnumber, and in a fortnight or three weeks could keep up with the others,\\\\r\\\\nand clean my proportion--twenty-five.\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCORD, STRING, THREAD.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeneral Remarks.--I have spoken of the strength of different cords in\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Alpine outfit,\\\\\\\" p. 48. All kinds of cord become exceedingly rotten in\\\\r\\\\nhot, dry countries: the fishermen of the Cape preserve their nets by\\\\r\\\\nsteeping them occasionally in blood. Thread and twine should be waxed\\\\r\\\\nbefore using them for sewing, whenever there is reason to doubt their\\\\r\\\\ndurability.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitutes.--The substitutes for thread, string, and cord, are as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--Thongs cut spirally, like a watch-spring, out of a piece of\\\\r\\\\nleather or hide, and made pliant by working them round a stick; sinew and\\\\r\\\\ncatgut (pp. 346); inner bark of trees--this is easily separated by\\\\r\\\\nlong steeping in water, but chewing it is better; roots of trees, as the\\\\r\\\\nspruce-fir, split to the proper size; woodbines, runners, or pliant\\\\r\\\\ntwigs, twisted together. Some seaweeds--the only English one of which I\\\\r\\\\nhave heard is the common olive-green weed called Chorda Filum; it looks\\\\r\\\\nlike a whip-thong, and sometimes grows to a length of thirty or forty\\\\r\\\\nfeet; when half-dried, the skin is taken off and twisted into\\\\r\\\\nfishing-lines, etc. Hay-bands; horsehair ropes, or even a few twisted\\\\r\\\\nhairs from the tail of a horse; the stems of numerous plants afford\\\\r\\\\nfibres that are more or less effective substitutes for hemp, those that\\\\r\\\\nare used by the natives of the country visited should be notices; \\\\\\\"Indian\\\\r\\\\ngrass\\\\\\\" is an animal substance attached to the ovaries of small sharks and\\\\r\\\\nsome other fish of the same class.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn lashing things together with twigs, hay-bands, and the like, the way\\\\r\\\\nof securing the loose ends is not by means of a knot, which usually\\\\r\\\\ncauses them to break, but by twisting the ends together until they\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"kink.\\\\\\\" All faggots and trusses are secured in this way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSewing.--Sewing Materials.--These are best carried in a linen bag; they\\\\r\\\\nconsist of sail needles, packed in a long box with cork wads at the ends,\\\\r\\\\nto preserve their points; a sailor's palm; beeswax; twine; awls;\\\\r\\\\nbristles; cobbler's wax; large bodkin; packing-needle; ordinary\\\\r\\\\nsewing-needles; tailor's thimble; threads; cottons; silks; buttons;\\\\r\\\\nscissors; and pins.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStitches.--The enthusiastic traveller should be thoroughly grounded by a\\\\r\\\\ntailor in the rudiments of sewing and the most useful stitches. They are\\\\r\\\\nas follows:--To make a knot at the end of the thread; to run; to stitch;\\\\r\\\\nto \\\\\\\"sew'\\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\" to fell, or otherwise to make a double seam; to herring-bone\\\\r\\\\n(essential for flannels); to hem; to sew over; to bind; to sew on a\\\\r\\\\nbutton; to make a button-hole; to darn; and to fine-draw. He should also\\\\r\\\\npractise taking patterns of some articles of clothing in paper, cutting\\\\r\\\\nthem out in common materials and putting them together. He should take a\\\\r\\\\nlesson or two from a saddler, and several, when on board ship, from a\\\\r\\\\nsail-maker.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNeedles, to make.--The natives of Unyoro sew their beautifully prepared\\\\r\\\\ngoat-skins in a wonderfully neat manner, with needles manufactured by\\\\r\\\\nthemselves. \\\\\\\"They make them not by boring the eye, but by sharpening the\\\\r\\\\nend into a fine point and turning it over, the extremity being hammered\\\\r\\\\ninto a small cut in the body of the needle, to prevent it from\\\\r\\\\ncatching.\\\\\\\"--Sir S. Baker.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMEMBRANE, SINEW, HORN.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nParchment--The substance which is called parchment when made from sheep\\\\r\\\\nor goat skins, and vellum when from those of calves, kids, or dead-born\\\\r\\\\nlambs, can also be made from any other skin. The raw hide is buried for\\\\r\\\\none or two days, till the hair comes off easily; then it is taken out and\\\\r\\\\nwell scraped. Next a skewer is run in and out along each of its four\\\\r\\\\nsides, and strings being made fast to these skewers, the skin is very\\\\r\\\\ntightly stretched; it is carefully scraped over as it lies on the\\\\r\\\\nstretch, by which means the water is squeezed out; then it is rubbed with\\\\r\\\\nrough stones, as pumice or sandstone, after which it is allowed to dry,\\\\r\\\\nthe strings by which the skewers are secured being tightened from time to\\\\r\\\\ntime. If this parchment be used for writing, it will be found rather\\\\r\\\\ngreasy, but washing it will oxgall will probably remedy this fault. (See\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Ox-gall,\\\\\\\" p. 331.) In the regular preparation of parchment, the skin is\\\\r\\\\nsoaked for a short time in a lime-pit before taking off the hairs, to get\\\\r\\\\nrid of the grease.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCatgut.--Steep the intestines of any animal in water for a day, peel off\\\\r\\\\nthe outer membrane, then burn the gut inside out, which is easily to be\\\\r\\\\ndone by turning a very short piece of it inside out, just as you would\\\\r\\\\nturn up the cuff of your sleeve; then, catching hold of the turned-up\\\\r\\\\ncuff, dip the whole into a bucket, and scoop up a little water between\\\\r\\\\nthe cuff and the rest of the gut.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of making catgut as described].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe weight of this water will do what is wanted: it will bear down an\\\\r\\\\nadditional length of previously unturned gut; and thus, by a few\\\\r\\\\nsuccessive dippings, the entire length of any amount of intestine,\\\\r\\\\nhowever narrow it may be, can be turned inside out in a minute or two.\\\\r\\\\nHaving turned the intestine inside out, scrape off the whole of its inner\\\\r\\\\nsoft parts; what remains is a fine transparent tube, which, being twisted\\\\r\\\\nup tightly and stretched to dry, forms catgut.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMembrane Thread.--Steep the intestines of any animal in water for a day;\\\\r\\\\nthen peel off the outer membrane, which will come off in long strips;\\\\r\\\\nthese should be twisted up between the hands, and hung out to dry; they\\\\r\\\\nform excellent threads for sewing skins together, or indeed for any other\\\\r\\\\npurpose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSinews for Thread.--Any sinews will do for making thread if the fibres\\\\r\\\\nadmit of being twisted or plaited together into pieces of sufficient\\\\r\\\\nlength. The sinews lying alongside the backbone are the most convenient,\\\\r\\\\non account of the length of their fibres. After the sinew is dried\\\\r\\\\nstraight strips are torn off it of the proper size; they are wetted, and\\\\r\\\\nscraped into evenness by being drawn through the mouth and teeth; then,\\\\r\\\\nby one or two rubs between the hand and the thigh, they become twisted\\\\r\\\\nand their fibres are retained together. A piece of dried sinew is usually\\\\r\\\\nkept in reserve for making thread or string.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGlue is made by boiling down hides, or even tendons, hoofs, and horns,\\\\r\\\\nfor a long time, taking care that they are not charred; then drawing off\\\\r\\\\nthe fluid and letting it set.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIsinglass is made readily by steeping the stomach and intestines of fish\\\\r\\\\nin cold water, and then gently boiling them into a jelly: this is spread\\\\r\\\\ninto sheets and allowed to dry. The air-bladder of the sturgeon makes the\\\\r\\\\ntrue isinglass. (See \\\\\\\"Paste and Gum,\\\\\\\" p. 332.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHorn, Tortoiseshell, and Whalebone.--Horn is so easily worked into shape\\\\r\\\\nthat travellers, especially in pastoral countries, should be acquainted\\\\r\\\\nwith its properties. By boiling, or exposing it to heat in hot sand, it\\\\r\\\\nis made quite soft, and can be moulded into whatever shape you will. Not\\\\r\\\\nonly this, but it can also be welded by heating and pressing two edges\\\\r\\\\ntogether, which, however, must be quite clean and free from grease, even\\\\r\\\\nthe touch of the hand taints them. Sheets of horn are a well-known\\\\r\\\\nsubstitute for glass, and are made as follows:--The horn is left to soak\\\\r\\\\nfor a fortnight in a pond; then it is well washed, to separate the pith;\\\\r\\\\nnext it is sawn lengthwise, and boiled till it can be easily split into\\\\r\\\\nsheets with a chisel; which sheets are again boiled, then scraped to a\\\\r\\\\nuniform thickness, and set into shape to dry. Tortoiseshell and whalebone\\\\r\\\\ncan be softened and worked in the same way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPOTTERY.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTO GLAZE POTTERY.--Most savages have pottery, but few know how to glaze\\\\r\\\\nit. One way, and that which was the earliest known of doing this, is to\\\\r\\\\nthrow handfuls of salt upon the jar when red-hot in the kiln. The reader\\\\r\\\\nwill doubtless call to mind the difficulties of Robinson Crusoe in making\\\\r\\\\nhis earthenware water-tight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitute for Clay.--In Damara land, where there is no natural material\\\\r\\\\nfitted for pottery, the savages procured mud from the interior of the\\\\r\\\\nwhite-ant hills, with which they made their pots. They were exceedingly\\\\r\\\\nbrittle, but nevertheless were large and serviceable for storing\\\\r\\\\nprovisions and even for holding water over the fire. I have seen them two\\\\r\\\\nfeet high. What it was that caused the clay taken from the ant-hills to\\\\r\\\\npossess this property, I do not know.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPots for Stores and Caches.--An earthen pot is excellent for a store of\\\\r\\\\nprovisions or for a cache, because it keeps out moisture and insects, and\\\\r\\\\nanimals cannot smell and therefore do not attack its contents.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCANDLES AND LAMPS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCandles.--Moulds for Candles.--It is usual, on an expedition, to take tin\\\\r\\\\nmoulds and a ball of wick for the purpose of making candles, from time to\\\\r\\\\ntime, when fat happens to be abundant. The most convenient mould is of\\\\r\\\\nthe shape shown in the figure. The tallow should be poured in, when its\\\\r\\\\nheat is so reduced that it hardly feels warm to the finger; that is, just\\\\r\\\\nbefore setting. If this be done over-night, the candles will come out in\\\\r\\\\nthe morning without difficulty. But, if you are obliged to make many at a\\\\r\\\\ntime, then, after the tallow has been poured in, the mould should be\\\\r\\\\ndipped in cold water to cool it: and then when the tallow has set, the\\\\r\\\\nmould should be dipped for a moment in hot water to melt the outside of\\\\r\\\\nthe newly-made candle and enable it to be easily extracted. By this\\\\r\\\\nmethod, the candles are not made so neatly as by the other, though they\\\\r\\\\nare made more quickly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of candle mould].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is well to take, if not to make, a proper needle for putting the wicks\\\\r\\\\ninto the moulds. It should be a hooked piece of wire, like a crochet\\\\r\\\\nneedle, which catches the wick by its middle and pulls it doubled through\\\\r\\\\nthe hole. A stick across the mouth of the mould secures the other end.\\\\r\\\\nWhen the tallow is setting, give an additional pull downwards. A\\\\r\\\\ngun-barrel, with a cork or wad put the required distance down the barrel,\\\\r\\\\nhas been used for a mould. Pull the candle out by the wick after heating\\\\r\\\\nthe barrel. Two wads might be used; the one strongly rammed in, to\\\\r\\\\nprevent the tallow from running too far, the other merely as a support\\\\r\\\\nfor the wick. Perhaps, even paper moulds might be used; they could be\\\\r\\\\nmade by gumming or pasting paper in a roll.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDip Candles.--Candles that are made by \\\\\\\"dipping,\\\\\\\" gutter and run much\\\\r\\\\nmore than mould candles, if they have to be used as soon as made. The way\\\\r\\\\nof dipping them is to tie a number of wicks to the end of a wooden\\\\r\\\\nhandle, so shaped that the whole affair looks much like a\\\\r\\\\ngarden-rake--the wicks being represented by the teeth of the rake; then\\\\r\\\\nthe wicks are dipped in the tallow, and each is rubbed and messed by the\\\\r\\\\nhand till it stands stiff and straight; after this they are dipped all\\\\r\\\\ntogether, several times in succession, allowing each fresh coat of tallow\\\\r\\\\nto dry before another dipping. Wax candles are always made by this\\\\r\\\\nprocess.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSubstitute for Candles.--A strip of cotton, 1 1/2 foot long, drenched in\\\\r\\\\ngrease, and wound spirally round a wand, will burn for half an hour. A\\\\r\\\\nlump of beeswax, with a tatter of an old handkerchief run through it,\\\\r\\\\nmakes a candle on an emergency.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaterials for Candles.--Tallow.--Mutton-suet mixed with ox-tallow is the\\\\r\\\\nbest material for candles. Tallow should never be melted over a hot fire:\\\\r\\\\nit is best to melt it by putting the pot in hot sand. To procure fat, see\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\"Greasing Leather,\\\\\\\" p. 343.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWax.--Boil the comb for hours, together with a little water to keep it\\\\r\\\\nfrom burning, then press the melted mass through a cloth into a deep\\\\r\\\\npuddle of cold water. This makes beeswax. (See \\\\\\\"Honey, to find,\\\\\\\" p. 199.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCandlestick.--A hole cut with the knife in a sod of turf or a potato; 3,\\\\r\\\\n4, or 5 nails hammered in a circle into a piece of wood, to act as a\\\\r\\\\nsocket; a hollow bone; an empty bottle; a strap with the end passed the\\\\r\\\\nwrong way through the buckle and coiled inside; and a bayonet stuck in\\\\r\\\\nthe ground, are all used as makeshift candlesticks. \\\\\\\"In bygone days the\\\\r\\\\nbroad feet, or rather legs, of the swan, after being stretched and dried,\\\\r\\\\nwere converted into candlesticks.\\\\\\\"--Lloyd.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLamps.--Lamps may be made of hard wood, hollowed out to receive the oil;\\\\r\\\\nalso of lead. (See \\\\\\\"Lead,\\\\\\\" p. 340.) The shed hoof of an ox or other beast\\\\r\\\\nis sometimes used.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSlush Lamp is simply a pannikin full of fat, with a rag wrapped round a\\\\r\\\\nsmall stick planted as a wick in the middle of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLantern.--A wooden box, a native bucket, or a calabash, will make the\\\\r\\\\nframe, and a piece of greased calico stretched across a hole in its side,\\\\r\\\\nwill take the place of glass. A small tin, such as a preserved-meat case,\\\\r\\\\nmakes a good lantern, if a hole is broken into the bottom, and an opening\\\\r\\\\nin the side or front. Horn (see p. 347) is easily to be worked by a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller into any required shape. A good and often a ready makeshift for\\\\r\\\\na lantern, is a bottle with its end cracked off. This is best effected by\\\\r\\\\nputting water into the bottle to the depth of an inch, and then setting\\\\r\\\\nit upon hot embers. The bottle will crack all round at the level of the\\\\r\\\\ntop of the water. It takes a strong wind to blow out a candle stuck into\\\\r\\\\nthe neck inside the broken bottle. Alpine tourists often employ this\\\\r\\\\ncontrivance when they start from their bivouac in the cark morning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Sketch of candle in bottle].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nON CONCLUDING THE JOURNEY.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nComplete your Collections.--When your journey draws near its close,\\\\r\\\\nresist restless feelings; make every effort before it is too late to\\\\r\\\\nsupplement deficiencies in your various collections; take stock of what\\\\r\\\\nyou have gathered together, and think how the things will serve in\\\\r\\\\nEngland to illustrate your journey or your book. Keep whatever is pretty\\\\r\\\\nin itself, or is illustrative of your every-day life, or that of the\\\\r\\\\nsavages, in the way of arms, utensils, and dresses. Make careful drawings\\\\r\\\\nof your encampment, your retinue, and whatever else you may in indolence\\\\r\\\\nhave omitted to sketch, that will possess an after-interest. Look over\\\\r\\\\nyour vocabularies for the last time, and complete them as far as\\\\r\\\\npossible. Make presents of all your travelling gear and old guns to your\\\\r\\\\nnative attendants, for they will be mere litter in England, costly to\\\\r\\\\nhouse and attractive to moth and rust; while in the country where you\\\\r\\\\nhave been travelling, they are of acknowledged value, and would be\\\\r\\\\nadditionally acceptable as keepsakes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMemoranda, to arrange.--Paste all loose slips of MSS. into the pages of a\\\\r\\\\nblank book; and stitch your memoranda books where they are torn; give\\\\r\\\\nthem to a bookbinder, at the first opportunity, to re-bind and page them,\\\\r\\\\nadding an abundance of blank leaves. Write an index to the whole of your\\\\r\\\\nMSS.; put plenty of cross-references, insert necessary explanations, and\\\\r\\\\nsupplement imperfect descriptions, while your memory of the events\\\\r\\\\nremains fresh. It appears impossible to a traveller, at the close of his\\\\r\\\\njourney, to believe he will ever forget its events, however trivial; for\\\\r\\\\nafter long brooding on few facts, they will seem to be fairly branded\\\\r\\\\ninto his memory. But this is not the case; for the crowds of new\\\\r\\\\nimpressions, during a few months or years of civilised life, will efface\\\\r\\\\nthe sharpness of the old ones. I have conversed with men of low mental\\\\r\\\\npower, servants and others, the greater part of whose experiences in\\\\r\\\\nsavagedom had passed out of their memories like the events of a dream.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlphabetical Lists.--Every explorer has frequent occasion to draw up long\\\\r\\\\ncatalogues in alphabetical order, whether of words for vocabularies, or\\\\r\\\\nof things that he has in store: now, there is a right and a wrong way of\\\\r\\\\nsetting to work to make them. The wrong way is to divide the paper into\\\\r\\\\nequal parts, and to assign one of them to each letter in order. The right\\\\r\\\\nway is to divide the paper into parts of a size proportionate to the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of words in the English language which begin with each particular\\\\r\\\\nletter. In the first case the paper will be overcrowded in some parts and\\\\r\\\\nutterly blank in others, in the second it will be equally overspread with\\\\r\\\\nwriting; and an ordinary-sized sheet of paper, if closely and clearly\\\\r\\\\nwritten, will be sufficient for the drawing up of a very extended\\\\r\\\\ncatalogue. A convenient way of carrying out the principle I have\\\\r\\\\nindicated is to take an English dictionary, and after having divided the\\\\r\\\\npaper into as many equal parts as there are leaves in the dictionary, to\\\\r\\\\nadopt the first word of each leaf as headings to them. It may save\\\\r\\\\ntrouble to my reader if I give a list of headings appropriate to a small\\\\r\\\\ncatalogue. We will suppose the paper to be divided into fifty-two\\\\r\\\\nspaces--that is to say, into four columns and thirteen spaces in each\\\\r\\\\ncolumn--then the headings of these spaces, in order, will be as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:--\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n      A              dul            pal            son\\\\r\\\\n      adv            eve            per            sta\\\\r\\\\n      app            fin            ple            sir\\\\r\\\\n      bal            gin            pre            sur\\\\r\\\\n      bil            hee            pro            tem\\\\r\\\\n      bre            imp            que            tos\\\\r\\\\n      cap            int            rec            tur\\\\r\\\\n      chi            k              reg            umb\\\\r\\\\n      col            lan            ria            une\\\\r\\\\n      com            mac            sab            ven\\\\r\\\\n      cra            mil            sca            wea\\\\r\\\\n      dec            nap            sha            wor\\\\r\\\\n      dis            off            siz            x y a\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVerification of Instruments.--On arriving at the sea-level, make daily\\\\r\\\\nobservations with your boiling-point thermometer, barometer, and aneroid,\\\\r\\\\nas they are all subject to changes in their index-errors. As soon as you\\\\r\\\\nhave an opportunity, compare them with a standard barometer, compare also\\\\r\\\\nyour ordinary thermometer and azimuth-compass with standard instruments,\\\\r\\\\nand finally, have them carefully re-verified at the Kew observatory on\\\\r\\\\nyour return to England. A vast deal of labour has been wholly thrown away\\\\r\\\\nby travellers owing to their neglecting to ascertain the index-errors of\\\\r\\\\nthese instruments at the close of their journey. A careful observer ought\\\\r\\\\nto have eliminated the effects of instrumental errors from his sextant\\\\r\\\\nobservations; nevertheless it will be satisfactory to him, and it may\\\\r\\\\nclear up some apparent anomalies, to have his entire instrumental outfit\\\\r\\\\nre-verified at Kew.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nObservations, to recalculate.--Send by post to England a complete copy\\\\r\\\\n(always preserve the originals) of all your astronomical observations,\\\\r\\\\nthat they may be carefully recalculated before your return, otherwise a\\\\r\\\\nlong period may elapse before the longitudes are finally settled, and\\\\r\\\\nyour book may be delayed through the consequent impossibility of\\\\r\\\\npreparing a correct map. The Royal Geographical Society has frequently\\\\r\\\\nprocured the re-calculation of observations made on important journeys,\\\\r\\\\nat the Royal Greenwich Observatory and elsewhere. I presume that a\\\\r\\\\nwell-known traveller would never find a difficulty in obtaining the\\\\r\\\\ncalculations he might desire, through the medium of that Society, if it\\\\r\\\\nwas distinctly understood that they were to be made at his own cost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLithograph Maps.--It may add greatly to the interest which a traveller\\\\r\\\\nwill take in drawing up a large and graphic route-map of his journey, if\\\\r\\\\nhe knows the extreme ease and cheapness with which copies of such a map\\\\r\\\\nmay be multiplied to any extent by a well-known process in lithography:\\\\r\\\\nfor these being distributed among persons interested in the country where\\\\r\\\\nhe has travelled, will prevent his painstaking from being lost to the\\\\r\\\\nworld. Sketches and bird'[S-eye views may be multiplied in the same\\\\r\\\\nmanner. The method to which I refer is the so-called Anastatic process;\\\\r\\\\nthe materials can be obtained, with full instructions, at any\\\\r\\\\nlithographer's shop, and consist of autographic ink and paper. The paper\\\\r\\\\nhas been prepared by being glazed over with a composition, and the ink is\\\\r\\\\nin appearance something like Indian ink, and used in much the same way.\\\\r\\\\nWith an ordinary pen, with this ink, and upon this paper, the traveller\\\\r\\\\ndraws his map; they are neither more nor less difficult to employ than\\\\r\\\\ncommon stationery, and he may avail himself of tracing-paper without\\\\r\\\\ndanger. He has one single precaution to guard against, which is, not to\\\\r\\\\ntouch the paper overmuch with his bare and, but to keep a bit of loose\\\\r\\\\npaper between it and the map as he draws. As soon as it is finished, the\\\\r\\\\nmap is taken to a lithographer, who puts it face downwards on a stone,\\\\r\\\\nand passes it under his press, when every particle of ink leaves the\\\\r\\\\nsurface of the paper and attaches itself to the surface of the stone,\\\\r\\\\nprecisely as though it had originally been written there; the glaze on\\\\r\\\\nthe paper, which prevents the ink from soaking into it, makes this\\\\r\\\\ntransference more easy and complete. The stone can now be worked with,\\\\r\\\\njust as a stone that has been regularly lithographed in the usual manner;\\\\r\\\\nthat is to say, printing ink may be rubbed over it and impressions may be\\\\r\\\\ntaken off in any number. It will be observed that the writing on the\\\\r\\\\npaper is reversed upon the stone, and is re-reversed, or set right again,\\\\r\\\\nin the impressions that are taken from it. The lithographer's charges for\\\\r\\\\nfurnishing autographic ink and paper, working the stone, striking off\\\\r\\\\nfifty copies of a folio size, and supplying the paper (common white\\\\r\\\\npaper) for the copies--in fact every expense included--need not exceed\\\\r\\\\nten shillings, and may be much less. If before drawing his map the\\\\r\\\\ntraveller were to go to some working lithographer and witness the\\\\r\\\\nprocess, and make two or three experiments in a small way, he would\\\\r\\\\nnaturally succeed all the better. A map drawn on a large scale, though\\\\r\\\\nwithout any pretension to artistic skill, with abundance of profile views\\\\r\\\\nof prominent landmarks, and copious information upon the routes that were\\\\r\\\\nexplored, written along their sides, would be of the utmost value to\\\\r\\\\nfuture travellers, and to geographers at home.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nINDEX.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAccumulators.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdvantages of Travel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgates for striking sparks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgreement with Servants.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlarm gun.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlloy for bullets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlkail.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlmanack, (see \\\\\\\"Diagram\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlpenstock.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlphabet, signal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlpine tent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmadou.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmmunition (See GUN FITTINGS and AMMUNITION).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnastatic process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnchors.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAndersson, Mr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAngareb (bedstead).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAngles, to measure; by means of chords.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnimal heat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnthills of white ants, as ovens; yellow ants, as signs of direction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArctic see \\\\\\\"Snow,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Esquimaux,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Climbing and Mountaineering.\\\\\\\".\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArms, weapons.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArrows; set by a springe; to poison; to shoot fish.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nArtificial horizon.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAshes, for soap; for salt; for saltpetre and touchpaper; bivouac in;\\\\r\\\\nin flooring; dressing skins.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAss; kicking, to check; braying.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAtkinson, Mr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAustin, Mr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAutographic ink.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAwnings, to boat; to litter; to tents.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAxe, for marking trees; for ice; to re-temper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAxletree, to mend; to prepare wood for.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBacks, sore.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBags for sleeping in; saddle-bags; bags carried over saddle;\\\\r\\\\non packsaddle; to tie the mouth of.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaines, Mr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaker, Sir S.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBaking Ball (bullet); poisoned (see \\\\\\\"Lead\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBallantyne, Mr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBamboo rafts; to dig with; to cut meat; to strike sparks;\\\\r\\\\nto boil water in; to hitch together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBarclay, Captain, of Ury.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBark, to strip; for boats; for water vessels; for string and\\\\r\\\\ncord; for cloth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBarrels, as water vessels; in digging wells; to make filters;\\\\r\\\\nas floats (see also \\\\\\\"Gourd-floats,\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBarth, Dr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBasket-work boats; bucket; to protect water-bags.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBath, vapour; bath-glove.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBattues, marking beaters at.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeach, bivouac on (see \\\\\\\"Dateram,\\\\\\\").\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeacons, fire and smoke.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeads, for presents and payments; as means of counting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeale, Lieutenant.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBearings by Compass, Sun, etc.--Pocket compass; bearings by\\\\r\\\\nsun and stars; other signs of direction; to follow a track at\\\\r\\\\nnight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBedding--General remarks; vital heat; mattresses and their\\\\r\\\\nsubstitutes; preparing the ground for bed; coverlets; pillows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBedstead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBees, to find hive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeke, Dr.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBelcher, Admiral Sir E.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBellows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBells for cattle; to strings (thieves).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBelt, life; for trousers; bundle tied to.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBengal fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBirds, flight of, shows water; dead game; direction of unseen\\\\r\\\\ncoast; Food of birds wholesome to man; rank birds, to prepare,\\\\r\\\\nfor eating; watchfulness of; (see \\\\\\\"Feathers,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Quills,\\\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nShooting and Game).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBirdlime.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBiscuit, meat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBivouac--General remarks on shelter; various methods of bivouacking;\\\\r\\\\nbivouac in special localities; in hostile country; in unhealthy\\\\r\\\\ncountries; flies at night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlacksmith's work (see Metals).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlack paint; lampblack.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBladder for carrying water (see \\\\\\\"Floats,\\\\\\\"; Membrane).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBlakiston, Captain, R.

It exists\\\\r\\\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\\\r\\\\npeople in all walks of life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\\\r\\\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\\\r\\\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\\\r\\\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\\\r\\\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\\\r\\\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\\\r\\\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\\\r\\\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\\\r\\\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\\\r\\\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\\\r\\\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\\\r\\\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\\\r\\\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\\\r\\\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\\\r\\\\nstatus with the IRS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\\\r\\\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\\\r\\\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\\\r\\\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\\\r\\\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\\\r\\\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\\\r\\\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\\\r\\\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\\\r\\\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\\\r\\\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\\\r\\\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\\\r\\\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\\\r\\\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\\\r\\\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\\\r\\\\ndonations.
